* A list of organizations

** Give Well
   The Give Well organization does rigorous research on
   organizations. That's the plus. Unfortunately, since they have
   stringent requirements, there are only a few organizations that
   make the cut. Evidence Action and Against Malaria Foundation are
   the main ones.


* TODO Donate $800 to [[https://secure.givewell.org/][Give Well]]
