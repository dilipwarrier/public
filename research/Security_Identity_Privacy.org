* Digital signatures                                                 :Review:

A digital signature is a cryptographic mechanism used to verify the
authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of digital data.

It uses asymmetric cryptography with two keys:
- Private key: known only to the signer
- Public key: shared with everyone

The private key creates the signature; the public key verifies it.
  1. Hashing the message:
     The message is run through a cryptographic hash function such as
     SHA-256, producing a fixed-length digest.
  2. Creating the signature:
     The signer’s private key encrypts the hash to produce the
     signature.
  3. Verification:
     The verifier decrypts the signature with the public key and
     compares the result to a freshly computed hash. If they match,
     the message is verified for integrity and authenticity.

For example, when Alice wants to send a certified email to Bob:
1. She hashes the email.
2. She encrypts the hash using her private key.
3. Bob uses Alice’s public key to decrypt and verify that:
   - The email was not altered.
   - It was really sent by Alice.
   Alice cannot claim that she did not send this message.

Digital signatures are often tied to digital certificates issued by
Certificate Authorities (CAs).  A certificate binds a person’s or
organization’s identity to their public key. It establishes trust by
linking a verified identity to a cryptographic key pair.  When you
see a verified signature in a PDF or website, you can trust both the
cryptography and the identity behind it.

The contents of a digital certificate are:
- Public key
- Identity information (name, organization, domain)
- Signature from the CA verifying the certificate’s authenticity
- Validity period and serial number

* Encryption                                                         :Review:

Encryption is the process of converting readable data (plaintext) into
an unreadable format (ciphertext) using a cryptographic key. It is
used to maintain confidentiality or secrecy.

- Types of encryption:
  - Symmetric encryption:
    The same key is used for both encryption and decryption (for example, AES).
  - Asymmetric encryption:
    A public key encrypts and a private key decrypts (for example, RSA or ECC).

- Hybrid encryption:
  Real systems use a hybrid approach:
  1. A random symmetric key encrypts the data.
  2. The symmetric key is encrypted using the recipient’s public key.
  This provides both speed and security.

- Goals of encryption:
  - Confidentiality: Only authorized parties can read the data.
  - Integrity: The data cannot be modified undetected.
  - Authentication: Confirms who the data came from when combined with signatures.

** Combining Encryption and Signatures
- Authentication and integrity are provided by digital signatures.
- Confidentiality is provided by encryption.

Two main orders are used:

*** a. Sign–then–Encrypt
1. The message is signed using the sender’s private key.
2. The signed message is encrypted using the recipient’s public key.
3. The recipient decrypts it with their private key and verifies the signature.

Advantages:
- Signature is hidden from outsiders.
- Ensures both secrecy and authenticity.

Used in S/MIME, PGP, and secure document exchange.

*** b. Encrypt–then–Sign
1. The message is encrypted using the recipient’s public key.
2. The ciphertext is signed with the sender’s private key.
3. The recipient verifies the signature and then decrypts.

Advantages:
- Signature covers the ciphertext itself.
- Useful for systems where intermediate parties handle encrypted data.

** Encryption in Motion (Encryption in Transit)
- Definition:
  Protects data while it is transmitted between systems, such as between a client and a server.

- Goal:
  Prevent interception or tampering during transmission.

- How it works:
  - Data is encrypted before leaving one system and decrypted only by the authorized receiver.
  - Common protocols:
    - TLS / SSL for HTTPS, IMAPS, SMTPS, APIs
    - SSH for secure remote connections
    - VPNs for full network encryption

- Example:
  When logging into a bank website, HTTPS (TLS) encrypts your credentials so attackers cannot read them in transit.

- Analogy:
  Like sending a sealed envelope through the mail; no one can read it while it is being delivered.

** Encryption at Rest
It protects data while it is stored on a disk, database, or cloud storage.

- Goal:
  Prevent unauthorized access if physical storage is stolen or compromised.

- How it works:
  - Data is stored in encrypted form.
  - Authorized users or services decrypt it only when needed.
  - Common techniques:
    - Full-disk encryption (BitLocker, FileVault, LUKS)
    - Database-level encryption (TDE in SQL Server, Oracle)
    - Cloud encryption (AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, Azure Key Vault)

- Example:
  A stolen laptop with disk encryption reveals only random data unless the thief has the key.

- Analogy:
  Like a locked safe; even if someone steals it, they cannot open it without the key.

* The practice of cybersecurity

Most orgs spend a lot of budget on employee training. However,
successful orgs spend a larger part of their cybersecurity budget on
certifications, consultants, etc.

* Identity

Most entities that require identity don't need all parts of your
identity. For instance, if you buy alcohol at a liquor store, you show
your state ID which shows your name, your photograph, your birth
date, and your residential address. However, the store owner only
needed your birth date and your photograph.

The fundamental problem to solve in identity, then, is to allow
requests for identity to get the needed information without getting
any extraneous information.
