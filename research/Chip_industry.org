* PC chip industry                                                   :Review:

As of early 2022, the PC chip industry has seen significant growth
in the first two years of the COVID pandemic (2020-22).  AMD has
about 20% share in the industry and has gained a large market share from
Intel.

PC shipments increased to about 340M units in CY21, compared
to an average of 265M units in the five years comprising CY15
through CY19. Forecasts are that this higher level will stay steady
but will not increase significantly. Intel is depending upon the
revenue from the PC market to fund an expensive effort to build up
manufacturing to compete with TSMC.

Other competitors are ARM (Apple used ARM technology for its
in-house chips) and Qualcomm which is making in-roads into the
market with Snapdragon.


* Relative sizes of markets                                          :Review:

In 2022, the units sold every year are as follows.
  - 1.5B smart phones (~150M smart phones/OEM)
  - 340M PCs/laptops
  - 80M cars

* NXP                                                                :Review:

** S32K

These are general-purpose MCUs typically with clock rates in 100s of
MHz.

S32K344 - 4 MB flash, 512 kB SRAM, 1x lockstep Cortex M7 core @ 160
MHz.

** S32G

These are network processors, typically with combinations of ARM
Cortex-M (real-time) and Cortex-A (application) cores. Clock rates
are in GHz for the Cortex-A (see screenshot below).

32 KB I-cache and D-cache and 512 KB L2 per cluster. 4-8 MB SRAM.

* Intel                                                              :Review:

In Sep 2025, Ben Thompson defended the case for the US government
acquiring a 10% stake in Intel [1].

His argument consists of two key points. First, chip investments need
to be in the 10-20 year time frame. No private market can meet that
demand fast enough. Chip purchasers will not buy from Intel without a
guarantee of their stability and Intel cannot invest without a
guaranteed market for its chips.

Secondly, due to the universality of chips, chip supply has strategic
importance for the country. Taiwan and Korea are very close to
China. A US military planner will perceive this as a threat that must
be mitigated by alternate sites for chip production. As a location
across the globe from China, the US provides a safer
alternative. Intel is the only company that has existing large chip
manufacturing sites in the US. Other companies like TSMC have promised
to build such sites but that will take years to bear fruit.

He acknowledges the two big counter-arguments. First, this creates
a troublesome precedent of government intervention in private
industry. It will naturally lead to the US government mandating other
companies to buy chips from Intel foundries. It will lead to
inefficiency and potential failure of the entire venture.

The base rate of success of government intervention in industry will
need to be looked at. In general, such base rates are quite
poor. However, we need to look at not just commercial success but also
geo-political success.

* TSMC                                                               :Review:

Every car has about 20 MCUs on average. About 70% of all those MCUs
are manufactured by TSMC. Yet, automotive chips are only 3% of TSMC
revenue.

* ASML                                                      :LinkedIn:Review:

I came across [[https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-50-most-valuable-companies-in-the-world-in-2023/?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_campaign=37abfa8c9a-TRT_27-Mar-2020_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_a56b12f9f5-37abfa8c9a-9546361][this infographic]] on the 50 most valuable companies in
the world. Most of the names in the IT sector are household names,
but ASML?

Netherlands-based ASML is the world leader in lithography
techniques for etching chips and deserves to be better known.

Companies like Applied Materials and Lam Research combine their
technology with layering techniques to build the multiple layers that
are needed for today's chips. For example, today's logic chips can
have up to 20 wiring layers stacked up, one on top of another.

Manufacturers like TSMC (also on that list) then manufacture
semiconductor chips using this layering technology.
