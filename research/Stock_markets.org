* Stock market performance                                           :Review:

In the 40 years leading up to 2021, global stocks had an average annual
return of 7.4% and global bonds 6.3%. However, the long-run averages
for those numbers are 5% and 1.7% a year respectively.

Youngsters investing after 2021 should not expect the returns of the past
40 years. Those returns have been extraordinary.
