* Problem versus solution                                        :MartyCagan:

  People have this overly simplistic notion that product management and
  product design work to define the problem, and then engineering works
  to build a solution.

  Such a nice, clean separation between what product and design do, and
  what engineering does.

  Unfortunately, this overly simplistic thinking usually kills any
  chance for real innovation.


* Product versus feature teams                                   :MartyCagan:

  Product teams are cross-functional (product, design, engineering),
  they are focused on and measured by outcomes, they are empowered to
  figure out the best way to solve problems.

  The purpose of a product team is to solve a problem in ways that the
  customer loves, yet work for the business.

  There are four types of product risks.
  - Value risk :: Will people use it?
  - Viability risk :: Will the solution work for our business?
  - Usability risk :: Will people figure out how to use it?
  - Feasibility risk :: Can we build it with the time, skills and technology we have?

  Risks 1 and 2 are owned by the product manager, risk 3 by the designer
  and risk 4 by the engineer.

  The crucial difference between a product team and a feature team is
  that the feature team doesn't have responsibility for the value and
  viability. Instead, some executive stakeholder does. When this
  happens, the team might not even believe that there's a viable
  product. This leads to friction aand dissonance.

  A true product team has responsibility and accountability.


* Competencies                                                   :MartyCagan:


** Competencies for a product manager

   A deep knowledge of:
   - your users and customers
   - the data that's generated about your products
   - your industry, and
   - how your business works.


** Competencies for the head of product management

   - Team Development
   - Product Vision
   - Execution
   - Product Culture
   - Empathy


* Feature prioritization                                           :LinkedIn:

  I was recently introduced to the Kano method of prioritization of
  features for a product (hat tip: Melissa Perri's product management
  online course and Wikipedia).

  Here's the rough model. Think of features in three categories.

  - Basic Needs :: Basic Needs are features that people take for
    granted. No one notices them when they work as they should. But if
    they arenâ€™t in place, your customer can get upset.  e.g. a clean
    room in a hotel.

  - Performance Needs :: Performance Needs are those needs that are
    top of mind and essential for users. The more of these that you
    implement, the more satisfied the user will be. e.g. a comfortable
    mattress in a hotel.

  - Delighters :: Delighters are features that cause excitement when
    fully implemented, but are unnoticeable if they are not included
    at all. e.g. free food upon check-in to a hotel.

  It's easiest to think of the categorization using the Wikipedia
  graph.

  If you want to satisfy your customer, meeting the basic needs might be
  enough but, if you want to delight your customer (and don't we all?),
  you must think about introducing delighters. The hard work, of course,
  is in identifying what those delighters are and how to accomplish them
  such that they serve both your customers and your business.
