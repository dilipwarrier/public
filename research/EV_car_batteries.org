#+Title: Data on car batteries

The [[https://cleantechnica.com/2018/09/29/nissans-long-strange-trip-with-leaf-batteries/][Nissan Leaf]] has had problems with the battery, especially in hot
conditions. The older battery models don't have a Thermal Management
System (TMS).

  Important factors for batteries are [[file:research/Screenshot 2022-03-05 141417.jpg][energy density]], power density, life span, cost and
  safety.

  The aim is to reduce cobalt usage in battery cathodes. [[file:research/Screenshot 2022-03-05 141932.jpg][Nickel]] is used
  quite a bit.

  The next generation technology is solid state. [[file:research/Screenshot 2022-03-05 142245.jpg][Lithium metal anode]] may
  still be required though for high energy density. However, you lose
  the lithium metal during discharge and get it back during charging.

  The advantages of solid state are higher energy density and improved
  safety because there is no flammable liquid. However, the lithium metal may
  increase costs.

  Various OEMs have different strategies for [[file:research/Screenshot 2022-03-05 142658.jpg][energy density]]. Lithium
  metal anodes have the highest energy density (350-500 Wh/kg) while
  Gr/Si anodes have 250-300 Wh/kg.

  Toyota is the world leader in patents on solid-state batteries.
