  [[file:research/Screenshot 2022-03-04 144459.jpg][Automotive market]] is dominant for lithium ion batteries.

  Important factors for batteries are [[file:research/Screenshot 2022-03-05 141417.jpg][energy density]], power density, life span, cost and
  safety.

  The aim is to reduce cobalt usage in battery cathodes. [[file:research/Screenshot 2022-03-05 141932.jpg][Nickel]] is used
  quite a bit.

  The next generation technology is solid state. [[file:research/Screenshot 2022-03-05 142245.jpg][Lithium metal anode]] may
  still be required though for high energy density. However, you lose
  the lithium metal during discharge and get it back during charging.

  The advantages of solid state are higher energy density and improved
  safety because there is no flammable liquid. However, the lithium metal may
  increase costs.

  Various OEMs have different strategies for [[file:research/Screenshot 2022-03-05 142658.jpg][energy density]]. Lithium
  metal anodes have the highest energy density (350-500 Wh/kg) while
  Gr/Si anodes have 250-300 Wh/kg.

  Toyota is the world leader in patents on solid-state batteries.

  [[file:research/Screenshot 2022-03-05 171057.jpg][Lifetime trend]]

  The [[https://cleantechnica.com/2018/09/29/nissans-long-strange-trip-with-leaf-batteries/][Nissan Leaf]] has had problems with the battery, especially in hot
  conditions. Older battery models do not have a Thermal Management
  System (TMS).


* Lithium carbonate

  Lithium carbonate is the main ingredient in lithium ion
  batteries. The demand for this chemical is expected to go up from
  600k tons on 2022 to 2.4M tons in 2030.

  Australia is the largest supplier with about 40% of the market. The
  triangle of Chile, Argentina and Bolivia have 66% of the world's
  lithium resources but have struggled to mine it properly.

* Lithium recycling

  There is a need to regenerate lithium and rare metals from batteries
  through recycling. The [[https://youtu.be/xLr0GStrnwQ][former CTO of Tesla]] has started a startup,
  Redwood Materials, aimed at this.


* Cold weather performance

  In cold weather, ICE engines recirculate the heat radiated by the
  engines into the cabin to warm it up. In contrast, EV batteries are
  efficient and do not radiate as much heat. So, the cabin has to be
  heated up using EV battery energy. As a result, EV range drops
  significantly in winter conditions.

  Per [[https://electrek.co/2022/12/13/worried-about-winter-range-loss-see-how-over-a-dozen-evs-compare/][this article,]] most EVs lose ~20% range at freezing temperature
  compared to 70 degrees Fahrenheit.


* EV global trends

  According to [[ev-volumes.com/#:~:text=For%20the%20full%20year%20of,are%20BEVs%20and%2030%20%25%20PHEVs][EV Volumes]], about 10.5M EVs were sold globally
  in 2022. This was 13% of all passenger vehicles. Out of this, about
  7.5M were BEVs and about 3M were PHEVs.

  Per slide 22 of the [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PbKV4vZi1Ss7P7m10blSwGAeI1459bPc/view][Volta Foundation Battery Report]], this number was
  a 57% increase from 2021. By 2030, the number is expected to be at
  47M (about 50% of the total passenger vehicle market). This is an
  average growth rate of 21% every year for 8 years.

  About 6.2M EVs were sold in China (about 60% of the global market),
  2.7M in Europe and 1.1m were sold in the US.

* Cell types and counts

  [[https://www.laserax.com/blog/ev-battery-cell-types][Pouch battery formats]] are most common in EVs. In this format, there
  are 100s of cells in an EV.

  The [[file:c:/Users/dwarr/Documents/GitHub/private/Battery_management_systems/Notes.org][Nissan Leaf]] has 48 2s2p battery
  modules = 192 cells for 24 kWh. The Nissan Leaf e+ has 62 kWh and a configurable
  number of cells per module. However, it's not clear how many modules
  are in a pack. See [[https://www.nissan-global.com/EN/INNOVATION/TECHNOLOGY/ARCHIVE/LI_ION_EV/#:~:text=In%20the%20second%20generation%20LEAF,as%20standard%2C%20increasing%20filling%20efficiency.][Nissan page]].

   They build software for batteries but so far don't advertise any
   automotive products. They do software for consumer batteries like
   in cell phones.

   However, they had a [[https://mobex.io/webinars/nxp-semiconductors-and-qnovo-collaborate-on-xev-battery-performance/][joint webinar with NXP]] on improving EV
   performance.
