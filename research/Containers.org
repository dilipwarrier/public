A container is a standardized unit that packages your code and
all its dependencies. Docker is a well-known container run-time
that simplifies the management of the entire stack needed for
container isolation.

Compared to VMs, containers don't have their own OS, so they can
start up very quickly.

* Orchestration                                                      :Review:

Orchestration tools allow you to start, stop, terminate, and monitor
container services.

For instance, Kubernetes orchestrates the following.

- Container placement :: Deciding which node runs which container

- Scaling :: Automatically adding or removing container replicas

- Load balancing :: Routing traffic to the right containers

- Self-healing :: Restarting failed containers

- Rolling updates :: Updating deployments with zero downtime

- Service discovery :: Giving containers stable network identities

- Configuration and secrets management ::

- Storage provisioning ::

Modern orchestrators are declarative, not imperative. For instance,
programmers do not state "Start a container" in Kubernetes. Instead,
they state that "There should be 3 replicas of service X." The
orchestrator runs control loops. The control loops continuously
compare the desired state with the actual state and reconcile any
differences.

* Services

A container is a run-time unit. On the other hand, a service is a
logical grouping of containers to provide some application-level
functionality e.g. a web front-end service.
