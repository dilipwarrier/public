A container is a standardized unit that packages up your code and
all its dependencies. Docker is a well-known container runtime
that simplifies the management of the entire stack needed for
container isolation.

Compared to VMs, containers don't have their own OS, so they can
start up very quickly.

* Orchestration                                                      :Review:

Orchestration tools allow you to start, stop, terminate, and monitor
container services.

Modern orchestrators are declarative, not
imperative. For instance, programmers do not state "Start
a container" in Kubernetes. Instead, they state that "There should be
3 replicas of service X." The orchestrator runs control loops that
continuously compare the desired state versus the actual and reconcile
them.

* Services

A container is a runtime unit. On the other hand, a service is a
logical grouping of containers to provide some application-level
functionality e.g. a web front-end service.
