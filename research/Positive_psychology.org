Ed Diener pioneered the concept of Subjective Well-Being (SWB). He
suggests that SWB consists of two components, Affective Balance and
Life Satisfaction. The SWB score is the sum of the two scores.

** Affective Balance

Affective balance is the difference between positive affects or
feelings and negative affects. This is a measure of the moods of a
person and is emotional in nature. An example measure for Affective
Balance is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_and_Negative_Affect_Schedule][Positive and Negative Affect Schedule]] (PANAS).

The brain has a negativity bias. We feel the loss of something more
sharply than the gain of an equal amount. Also, negative feelings are
generated much faster through the amygdala than positive feelings.

You can't completely be rid of the negative feelings in the left
column below. In the short-term, you will be overcome by them but you
should try to move towards the positive feelings on the right in the
long-term.

*** The source of true happiness
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       f3c5151b-e88c-42f8-837b-a7794d2ba35b
:END:

Marcus Aurelius suggests in "Meditations" that strengthening the
values on the right is the true path to happiness. These values
are entirely in our character and, hence, entirely within our
control. Everything else - health, wealth, etc - are not
within our control.

*** Regret to Learning

Annie Duke in "Thinking in Bets" reminds us that, just because the
outcome of a decision turned out poorly, it does not follow that the
decision choice was poor. In fact, it may have been your best choice a
priori. Learn to make that distinction. True learning is when you
learn how to make better decisions based on a priori knowledge. Regret
is when you rue a decision based on an unfavorable outcome.

*** Pride to Humility

There are people in the world who are doing greater and better things
than you are. So, you can strive to be humble about whatever you have
accomplished.

At the same time, if you do not commit unethical or
illegal acts and if you have helped others, you have done more than
many people. So, you can be justifiably proud of such actions.

** Life Satisfaction
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       3884f562-7a2e-4e3a-893e-20e9791ca16f
:END:

Life Satisfaction (LS) is the satisfaction with important life
domains - society, work, and self. This is a cognitive measure
i.e. it is how you would evaluate life if you stepped back to reflect
on it. LS is more long-term while Affective Balance can
show short-term fluctuations.

One of the most important influences on LS is social
relationships. People who score high on LS tend to have close and
supportive family and friends, whereas those who do not have close
friends and family are more likely to be dissatisfied.

Another factor is work or, more generally, performance in an important
role such as homemaker or grandparent. When the person enjoys their
work, and feels that it is meaningful and important, it increases
their LS. When work is going poorly because of bad external
circumstances or a poor fit with the person’s strengths, this can
lower LS.

Human beings generally feel pleasure from working towards a goal. The
goal has to be challenging but achievable and they should get regular
feedback. This allows them to achieve a state of flow. However, even
though they think there is pleasure to be gained on achieving a goal,
they do not actually gain such pleasure. Eg. winning a lottery,
getting your ideal job, etc. This is analogous to the movie "Memento"
where the protagonist continually sets new goals to challenge himself.

A third factor that influences the LS of most people is
personal – satisfaction with the self, religious or spiritual life,
learning and growth, and leisure. For many people, these are sources of
satisfaction. However, when these sources of personal worth are
frustrated, they can be powerful sources of dissatisfaction.

There could be additional sources of satisfaction and dissatisfaction
– common sources such as health and other sources that
are unique to each individual. Most people know the factors that lead
to their satisfaction or dissatisfaction, although a person’s
temperament – a general tendency to be happy or unhappy – can color
their responses. This temperament is highly correlated with genes.

There is no single key to LS. However, a dissatisfied
person can increase their LS with time and effort. For
instance, people who suffer a loss recover over time. People who have
dissatisfaction in any one domain often make changes over time that
will increase their satisfaction. If a person is chronically
dissatisfied, they should look within themselves and develop more
positive attitudes to life and the world.

Buddha said that happiness comes from within. It cannot be achieved by
making the outside world conform to your wishes. Modern positive
psychology agrees.

All of this is nicely captured in this cartoon.

* A Buddhist take on happiness                                       :Review:

We look for happiness outside ourselves when it is basically an inner
state of being.

The essential thing is to identify the types of mental activity that
lead to well being and those that lead to suffering, even when the
latter afford us brief instances of pleasure.

Systematically blaming others and holding them responsible for our
suffering is the surest way to lead an unhappy life.

Recognize your aspiration for happiness, then extend that aspiration
to those you love and finally to your friends, strangers and even your
enemies. Little by little, altruism and benevolence will saturate your
mind, until it becomes second nature.

Boredom is the fate of those who rely entirely on distraction, for
whom life is one big entertainment.

* Measurements of quality of life                                    :Review:

A commonly used quantitative measurement of life is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year][Quality-adjusted
life year]] or QALY. A QALY measure of 1.0 means a year of perfect
health while values below that mean less than perfect health or
quality of life. A value of 0 represents death. Different
interventions can be measured by summing up the resulting measures
over the number of years of life that they provide.

[[https://www.wsj.com/articles/obscure-model-puts-a-price-on-good-healthand-drives-down-drug-costs-11572885123][This article]] talks about the use of QALYs by a research
organization called ICER in the US and how it could reduce drug
prices. While other countries have adopted QALY as a measure, the
US has not yet.

From the [[ https://www.wsj.com/articles/obscure-model-puts-a-price-on-good-healthand-drives-down-drug-costs-11572885123][WSJ article]], ICER puts the cost of one QALY in the US at
$150,000. A graph of QALYs used by other countries is in the
article. The approach of using QALYs was first established in the
UK.
