* Skewness

The skewness or skew of a set of values measures the asymmetry of the values
around the mean value.

One formula to measure skew is Pearson's median skew.

\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Pearson's\ median\ skew} = 3 \times \frac{\mu - \mathrm{Median}}{\sigma}
\end{equation}

* Kurtosis

Kurtosis measures whether there is a long-tail to the
distribution.

\begin{equation*}
\mathrm{Kurtosis} = \frac{E[(X - \mu)^4]}{\sigma^4}
\end{equation}

A normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3, so other
distributions are characterized by a value of excessive
kurtosis. Excessive kurtosis is defined as kurtosis minus 3.
