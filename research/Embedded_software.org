:END:

Their flagship product is the Qt cross-platform UI framework.

In Oct 2025, Qt acquired IAR compiler systems for cash.

In Sep 2025, Qt signed a deal with Suzuki which would use the Qt
framework on top of AGL to build the UI for its e-Vitara BEV.

In May 2025, Qt announced an intention to become a tech-agnostic
platform and move away from only supporting C/C++. On the back-end,
they will support Java, Kotlin, and Rust. Further, they will support a
Figma to Qt plug-in to allow designers to convert design into code.

In 2022, Qt acquired Axivion for static analysis and architecture
analysis. Axivion was headquartered in Stuttgart with roughly 30
employees.

In 2021, Qt acquired Froglogic for test automation.

Formerly, Trolltech, then Nokia, then Digia, then Qt group.

*** My experience with Qt development

*** Business briefing

This document is the complete 5-page strategic briefing for the CTO role at
Qt Group. It reflects the outward-facing, visionary, ecosystem-oriented nature
of the role and incorporates the 2025 press release describing Qt's shift from
a C++-centric framework to a technology-agnostic, multi-language platform.

The CTO role is not about execution management. It is about vision-setting,
external influence, ecosystem leadership, and internal mentorship.

**** Executive Summary

Qt Group Plc is a global software platform company headquartered in Espoo,
Finland. Qt provides the Qt Framework and related tools used to build
cross-platform applications and embedded systems from a single codebase.

Qt serves 1.5M+ developers in >70 industries, including automotive,
medical devices, industrial automation, robotics, consumer electronics, and

Qt generated approx 209M EUR revenue in 2024 with strong EBIT margins
(approx 30 percent). The company is currently undergoing a strategic shift
toward cloud-enabled workflows, subscription revenue, AI-driven tooling,
developer experience innovation, and expanded toolchain consolidation after
acquiring IAR Systems.

In May 2025, Qt publicly announced a move away from being "C++-centric" toward
a "technology-agnostic Qt ecosystem" with support for Rust, Java, Kotlin,
Swift, Python, .NET, and more. This represents a major expansion of Qt's
addressable developer base and a significant strategic inflection point.

The CTO role is outward-facing: representing Qt globally, analyzing trends,
championing the platform vision, guiding long-term direction, and mentoring
internal engineering leaders through influence.

**** Company Overview

Qt began as Trolltech (Norway, 1994), was acquired by Nokia, transitioned to
Digia, and was spun out and listed as Qt Group Plc in 2016. This history has
given Qt a rare combination of embedded-system maturity, UI excellence, and
cross-platform engineering depth.

Qt generates revenue from:
- Commercial developer licenses
- Embedded device distribution licenses
- Long-term support (LTS) contracts
- Consulting and support services
- Quality assurance tooling from Axivion and Froglogic
- Compiler and toolchain products from IAR Systems

Qt is transitioning toward recurring revenue and integrated cloud workflows.

Qt supports:
- Desktop (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Mobile (iOS, Android)
- Embedded Linux (Yocto, Buildroot)
- RTOS environments (QNX, VxWorks, FreeRTOS)
- Automotive IVI and digital cockpit systems
- Industrial HMIs and medtech UI systems
- Simulation and digital twin tools

Qt is one of few frameworks able to scale from MCU-level embedded devices to
full desktop applications.

**** Strategic Industry Trends Impacting Qt

In May 2025, Qt announced a technology-agnostic strategy allowing developers
to work in Rust, Kotlin, Java, Swift, Python, .NET, and more via bridging
technology. This signals Qt’s evolution from a C++-centric library to a
universal, multi-language UI and application engine.

This change makes Qt relevant to:
- Mobile-first developers (Kotlin/Java/Swift)
- Systems programmers (Rust)
- Scripting and automation developers (Python)
- Enterprise and backend developers (.NET)

This is one of the most significant expansions of Qt's addressable market.

AI is reshaping development lifecycles:
- AI code generation for C++ and embedded targets
- AI-driven UI design
- Automated test creation
- AI-enhanced profiling and static analysis
- Predictive debugging and defect classification

Qt must articulate an AI strategy aligned with embedded constraints and cloud
augmentation.

Virtually every physical product now needs:
- A display
- Connectivity
- OTA updates
- Local compute
- Strong security

Qt’s depth in embedded and low-power environments positions it for expansion.

Automotive OEMs are consolidating displays and IVI systems. Qt is used in many
OEMs and suppliers. Automotive demands:
- Deterministic rendering
- Low-latency performance
- Certification-ready code
- Long-term support (10-15 years)

Qt’s combination of GUI engine + QA tools + static analysis is valuable here.

Qt is moving toward SaaS, cloud-based development workflows, telemetry, and
subscription licensing. This requires:
- Cloud-native services
- Usage tracking
- Developer portals
- Security and multi-tenant design

**** Strategic Drivers and Risks

- Expansion into multi-language ecosystems (Rust, Kotlin, Java, Swift, Python)
- Automotive digital cockpit growth
- Industrial HMI modernization
- Medtech device UI evolution
- AI-assisted workflows
- End-to-end toolchain consolidation with Axivion, Froglogic, IAR
- Cloud-enabled collaboration and development

- Competition from Flutter, React Native, and WASM environments
- Fragmentation of the open-source landscape
- Potential loss of relevance if the developer community shifts away from C++
  and Qt fails to adopt multi-language support quickly
- Hardware shifts such as RISC-V, custom SoCs
- Increasing expectations for AI-native tooling

**** Differentiation Through Acquisitions

Qt’s acquisitions create an end-to-end embedded development platform.

Axivion Suite provides:
- Static code analysis for C, C++, C#, CUDA
- MISRA, AUTOSAR, CERT, CWE checks
- Architecture verification
- Dead code and cycle detection
- Technical debt management
- CI/CD integration
- Safety certifications (ISO 26262 ASIL D, IEC 61508 SIL 4, IEC 62304)

This allows Qt to offer a safety-oriented pipeline unmatched by UI-only tools.

Squish GUI Tester
- Automated cross-platform GUI testing
- Supports Qt, web, Java, .NET, mobile, embedded
- Object-based recognition for stability
- Python and JavaScript scripting
- Deep Qt Creator integration

Test Center
- Aggregates results, coverage, requirements mapping
- Central dashboard for QA analytics
- Supports regulated industries

Squish + Test Center let Qt own the GUI quality lifecycle.

IAR provides:
- High-performance compilers for 20+ MCU architectures
- Debugger (C-SPY)
- Static analysis (C-STAT)
- Runtime checks (C-RUN)
- Safety-certified toolchains

Qt + Axivion + Froglogic + IAR is the only platform offering:

Compiler -> Static Analysis -> Runtime Checks -> GUI Testing -> App Framework

This is a major competitive moat for embedded industries.

* Software companies working on EVs and batteries                    :Review:

** Qnovo

Qnovo has a [[https://www.qnovo.com/news/borgwarner-and-ogci-climate-investments-complete-new-investments-in-qnovo-in-24m-series-c-funding][$24M Series-C funding]] from Borg-Warner among others.

They build software for batteries but so far don't advertise any
automotive products. They do software for consumer batteries like
in cell phones.

However, they had a [[https://mobex.io/webinars/nxp-semiconductors-and-qnovo-collaborate-on-xev-battery-performance/][joint webinar with NXP]] on improving EV performance.

03:00 - Cloud software connected to high-performance embedded
        connected to edge
14:00 - Tesla is very efficient in sending data back to the cloud
16:00 - Need for microservices

** NXP presentation on [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CwpQtYjES7SIZdqAIBEjyhuh_g1udObI/view?usp=share_link][Software Defined Vehicles]]

OEMs are looking for reduced costs of software integration (70% of
software costs is in integration).

This could be achieved through:
- Zonal architectures where computing-intensive non-real-time
  tasks are done in general-purpose application processors as
  opposed to dedicated processors
- Applications are written in higher-level languages and use
  off-the-shelf software components
- Applications in the car communicate with applications in the cloud
  to provide maximum value
- Applications are deployed as microservices through efficient
  cloud-based deployment and maintenance tools

** Trends                                                          :LinkedIn:

While "software defined vehicles" is still a nebulous concept, a few
key factors are clear.

1. Processing distributed between applications in the cloud,
   microservices on application processors in the car and
   real-time critical software on edge sensors in the car
2. Complexity on the edge reducing over time and moving to
   application processors in the middle
3. Cloud configuration and maintenance of application software through
   over-the-air updates
4. Capability to deploy new features and improve existing features
   over time
5. More software in the car developed in higher-level programming
   languages rather than in C/C++.

Here's a great discussion from CES 2023 by Munro live talking about
all these. Note especially at the 3-min mark, the conversation about
(1) and (2). Tools such as AWS Workbench will help simplify (3) and
(4). Everything here makes sense and the economics is going to work
in favor of these trends - higher labor supply for higher-level
programming languages, reducing costs of application processors and
carry-over from mobile phones, availability and growth of OSs like
Android from the mobile industry, ease of deployment of AWS and
other cloud platforms etc.

Exciting times ahead for automotive software!
