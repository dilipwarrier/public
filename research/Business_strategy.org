* Purpose, vision, mission, and strategy                             :Review:

  Accordingly:
  - Company purpose - answers the why - 50-100 year timeline
  - Company vision - answers the how - 25 year timeline
  - Company mission - anwers the what - 10 year timeline
  - Company strategy - Set of goals and actions - 3 year timeline

  - Why are we doing what we are doing?

  - How are we addressing our customer needs? This is usually covered
    in a business plan or [[file:Business_model_generation.org][business model canvas]].
    + Skills, technology, knowledge, competencies

  - What is our business?
    1. Who are we satisfying? (Customer groups)
    2. What needs are we satisfying? (Customer needs)

  This is a customer-oriented business definition rather than a
  product-oriented business definition.  A product-oriented definition
  can obscure the true mission. For instance, many typewriter companies
  missed that their organization's business was satisfying the customer
  need of information processing. When IBM redefined information
  processing by moving into computers, these typewriter companies lost
  out.

  The vision of the company is a high level statement for where the
  company wants to be. It articulates, often in broad terms, what a
  company hopes to achieve. The vision often includes values which
  describe how the company will operate.

  The goals or strategy break down the vision into SMART objectives.


* Financial metrics for a company                                    :Review:

  A company is usually focused on providing value to shareholders while
  maintaining ethics and values. The valuation of a company is driven
  by:
  1. ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) = NOPLAT (Net Operating Profit
     Less Applicable Taxes) divided by IC = equity + debt
  2. Growth rate of profitability = rate at which NOPLAT increases per year

  ROIC = Net profit/Invested capital = (Net profit/Sales) * (Sales/invested capital)

  That can further be divided up as follows, to understand where the
  firm stands in terms of competitive advantage on each factor.

  Together, these two factors and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital
  (WACC) determine the valuation of the company. This can be calculated
  using cash flow analysis.

* External analysis                                                  :Review:

  Each of these competitive forces could be a strength or a weakness.
  - Risk of entry
  - Rivalry among established firms
  - Bargaining power of buyers
  - Bargaining power of suppliers
  - Threat of substitutes
  - Power of complement providers

  Risk of entry or barrier to entry includes brand loyalty along with
  factors such as government regulation, switching costs etc.

  Rivalry among established firms is usually high in industries with low
  switching costs and solutions that are undifferentiated. This usually
  results in boom-and-bust cycles where new entrants try to flood the
  market with low-cost products in hopes to unseat the incumbents. This
  creates excess capacity reducing prices which forces the incumbents to
  react. A fragmented industry structure constitutes a threat rather
  than an opportunity.

  Complement providers are those who provide complementary products
  using your products. For instance, gaming companies provide game
  cartridges on platforms like Xbox and Nintendo. These can determine
  the success of the platforms.

  The problems with analyses like the competitive forces analysis are as
  follows. These problems indicate that just a competitive force
  analysis won't suffice.

  - They may not apply during times of significant innovation and
    disruption. They are more applicable in steady state for the
    industry.
  - According to some research, they only account for 10-20% of the
    variance in performance of companies. Thus, being in an attractive
    industry alone does not guarantee success. Internal factors within
    the company are much more important.
  - The macroenvironment can change the market forces significantly.

  A case study is the industry for large commercial airline jets. This
  market is dominated by Boeing and Airbus. However, pre-COVID19, the
  market for international travel was growing significantly as people
  from developing countries travel more (see [[https://www.evernote.com/shard/s104/nl/11741856/b716c243-abb9-4edc-807d-a6b75f11ac3e/][this talk]] for how other
  countries are fast becoming able to afford flights). This was making
  it more attractive for small companies like Embraer and Bombardier
  to enter the market. The additional competition could intensify
  rivalry.


* Internal Analysis                                                  :Review:

  Case study: For 4 decades, Southwest airlines has consistently
  outperformed the airline market. Even in 2001-05, it returned almost
  6% on invested capital. It has distinct features from other
  airlines: point to point flights from smaller airports as opposed to
  spoke and hub models, only one type of jet used, no seat
  reservations, no participation in external ticketing sites, no
  baggage transfers to other airlines etc.

  A firm has competitive advantage when it has better than the average
  profitability of other firms in the industry. It has sustained
  competitive advantage when it maintains that profitability for a
  long period.

  Competitive advantage may be gained through one or more unique
  competencies. Competencies could be a firm's access to basic resources
  (land, labor, capital, equipment). It could be process
  knowledge. Process knowledge is the organization's equivalent of human
  skills ie the routines and behaviors through which an organization
  creates output. It could be the organizational architecture eg Apple
  has a strong industrial design group that coordinates hardware,
  software and manufacturing for a product. Finally, it could be unique
  IP that a firm possesses.

  The VRIO framework gives a good way of thinking about which
  resources can be a sustainable competitive advantage.  VRIO stands
  for Value, Rarity, Inimitability and Organization.

  Typically, the advanced resources (IP, process knowledge and
  organizational architecture) are the ones that confer a sustained
  competitive advantage. Those can be valuable, rare and inimitable.


* Competitive Advantage Through Functional Strategy                  :Review:

  All functions such as R&D, marketing, sales, manufacturing etc can
  contribute towards strategies of higher efficiency, quality,
  innovation, and customer responsiveness. These functional strategies
  allow companies to achieve competitive advantages that drive value
  creation. Quality can be quality as reliability or quality as
  excellence.

* Business level strategy                                            :Review:

  The cost and differentiation axes provide a frontier that industries
  operate at. It is possible to move the frontier out through technology,
  processes etc. Dell did this most famously in the computer industry and
  Toyota in the automotive industry. This process is called value
  innovation.

  The cost/differentiation and market segmentation gives four broad
  choices of business level strategy, as shown below.

  [[file:Screenshot 2024-02-17 1612.jpg]]

  Kim and Maugborne ("Blue ocean strategy") say that, for true value
  innovation, companies must think through the following four
  aspects.

  - Eliminate: What factors do rivals take for granted that can be
    eliminated, reducing costs?

  - Reduce: What factors can be reduced, reducing costs?

  - Raise: What factors can be raised above the standard in the
    industry, increasing value?

  - Create: What factors can be created that don't exist, increasing
    value?

* Business Strategy And Market Environment                           :Review:

  An industry goes from an embryonic stage to a mass market stage when
  the following events happen.

  - Technology progresses so that the average consumer finds value in
    the product.

  - Complementary products are developed so that the product value
    increases.

  - Many companies join the industry and drive down prices.

  Market adoption usually follows an S-curve as below.
