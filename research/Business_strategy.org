* Purpose, vision, mission, and strategy                             :Review:

- Company purpose - answers the why - 50-100 year timeline
- Company vision - answers the how - 25 year timeline
- Company mission - anwers the what - 10 year timeline
- Company strategy - Set of goals and actions - 3 year timeline

- Why are we doing what we are doing?

- How are we addressing our customer needs? This is usually covered
  in a business plan or [[file:Business_model_generation.org][business model canvas]].
  + Skills, technology, knowledge, competencies

- What is our business?
  + Who are we satisfying? (Customer groups)
  + What needs are we satisfying? (Customer needs)

This is a customer-oriented business definition rather than a
product-oriented business definition.  A product-oriented definition
can obscure the true mission. For instance, many typewriter companies
missed that their organization's business was satisfying the customer
need of information processing. When IBM redefined information
processing by moving into computers, these typewriter companies lost
out.

The vision of the company is a high level statement for where the
company wants to be. It articulates, often in broad terms, what a
company hopes to achieve. The vision often includes values which
describe how the company will operate.

The goals or strategy break down the vision into SMART objectives.

* Financial metrics for a company                                    :Review:

A company is usually focused on providing value to shareholders while
maintaining ethics and values. The valuation of a company is driven
by:
1. ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) = NOPLAT (Net Operating Profit
   Less Applicable Taxes) divided by IC = equity + debt
2. Growth rate of profitability = rate at which NOPLAT increases per year

ROIC = Net profit/Invested capital = (Net profit/Sales) * (Sales/invested capital)

That can further be divided up as follows, to understand where the
firm stands in terms of competitive advantage on each factor.

Together, these two factors and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital
(WACC) determine the valuation of the company. This can be calculated
using cash flow analysis.

* External analysis                                                  :Review:

Each of these competitive forces could be a strength or a weakness.
- Risk of entry
- Rivalry among established firms
- Bargaining power of buyers
- Bargaining power of suppliers
- Threat of substitutes
- Power of complement providers

Risk of entry or barrier to entry includes brand loyalty along with
factors such as government or industry regulation, switching costs, etc.

Rivalry among established firms is usually high in industries with low
switching costs and solutions that are undifferentiated. This usually
results in boom-and-bust cycles where new entrants try to flood the
market with low-cost products in hopes to unseat the incumbents. This
creates excess capacity reducing prices which forces the incumbents to
react. A fragmented industry structure constitutes a threat rather
than an opportunity.

Complement providers are those who provide complementary products
using your products. For instance, gaming companies provide game
cartridges on platforms like Xbox and Nintendo. These can determine
the success of the platforms.

The problems with analyses like the competitive forces analysis are as
follows. These problems indicate that just a competitive force
analysis won't suffice.

- They may not apply during times of significant innovation and
  disruption. They are more applicable in steady state for the
  industry.
- According to some research, they only account for 10-20% of the
  variance in performance of companies. Thus, being in an attractive
  industry alone does not guarantee success. Internal factors within
  the company are much more important.
- The macro environment can change the market forces significantly.

[[file:Screenshot 2024-02-17.jpg]]

A case study is the industry for large commercial airline jets. This
market is dominated by Boeing and Airbus. However, pre-COVID19, the
market for international travel was growing significantly as people
from developing countries travel more (see [[https://www.evernote.com/shard/s104/nl/11741856/b716c243-abb9-4edc-807d-a6b75f11ac3e/][this talk]] for how other
countries are fast becoming able to afford flights). This makes
it more attractive for small companies like Embraer and Bombardier
to enter the market. The additional competition could intensify
rivalry.

* Internal Analysis                                                  :Review:

Case study: For four decades, Southwest airlines has consistently
outperformed the airline market. Even in 2001-05, it returned almost
6% on invested capital. It has distinct features from other
airlines: point to point flights from smaller airports as opposed to
spoke and hub models, only one type of jet used, no seat
reservations, no participation in external ticketing sites, no
baggage transfers to other airlines etc.

A firm has competitive advantage when it has better than the average
profitability of other firms in the industry. It has sustained
competitive advantage when it maintains that profitability for a
long period.

Competitive advantage may be gained through one or more unique
competencies. Competencies could be a firm's access to basic resources
(land, labor, capital, equipment). It could be process
knowledge. Process knowledge is the organization's equivalent of human
skills ie the routines and behaviors through which an organization
creates output. It could be the organizational architecture eg Apple
has a strong industrial design group that coordinates hardware,
software and manufacturing for a product. Finally, it could be unique
IP that a firm possesses.

The VRIO framework gives a good way of thinking about which
resources can be a sustainable competitive advantage.  VRIO stands
for Value, Rarity, Inimitability and Organization.

Typically, the advanced resources (IP, process knowledge and
organizational architecture) are the ones that confer a sustained
competitive advantage. Those can be valuable, rare and inimitable.

* Competitive Advantage through functional strategy                  :Review:

All functions such as R&D, marketing, sales, manufacturing etc can
contribute towards strategies of higher efficiency, quality,
innovation, and customer responsiveness. These functional strategies
allow companies to achieve competitive advantages that drive value
creation. Quality can be quality as reliability or quality as
excellence.

* Business level strategy                                            :Review:

The cost and differentiation axes provide a frontier that industries
operate at. It is possible to move the frontier out through technology,
processes etc. Dell did this in the computer industry and
Toyota in the automotive industry. This process is called value
innovation.

[[file:Screenshot 2024-02-17 1619.jpg]]

The cost/differentiation and market segmentation gives four broad
choices of business level strategy, as shown below.

[[file:Screenshot 2024-02-17 1612.jpg]]

Kim and Maugborne ("Blue ocean strategy") say that, for true value
innovation, companies must think through the following four
aspects.

- Eliminate: What factors do rivals take for granted that can be
  eliminated, reducing costs?

- Reduce: What factors can be reduced, reducing costs?

- Raise: What factors can be raised above the standard in the
  industry, increasing value?

- Create: What factors can be created that don't exist, increasing
  value?

* Market stages                                                      :Review:

An industry goes from an embryonic stage to a mass market stage when
the following events happen.

- Technology progresses so that the average consumer finds value in
  the product.

- Complementary products are developed so that the product value
  increases.

- Many companies join the industry and drive down prices.

Market adoption usually follows an S-curve as below.

[[file:Screenshot 2024-02-17 1634.jpg]]

* Strategy and technology

The Blu-ray/HD-DVD war shows how technology can affect business strategy. From
2003 to 2008, Toshiba and Sony competed fiercely on the format of these disc
players. By 2008, Toshiba conceded defeat and Blu-ray became the de facto
standard. However, that same year, online streaming of video started taking off.
Most households didn't have the bandwidth to stream in HD and most streaming was
in standard definition. By 2014, Sony had announced decline in sales of Blu-ray
players and discs compared to forecasts.

Typically, a lot of companies will wage standards wars to gain a competitive
advantage in high tech industries. These can end up being "winner take all"
games due to the high costs of developing products adhering to multiple
standards.

Tactics that can be useful to create a technology standard include improving the
set of complementary providers, providing killer apps, licensing the format and
using pricing tactics like "razor and blades pricing".

Another unique property of technology is the rapid improvement in technology
that can be achieved over just a few years. Firms can improve technology faster
than consumers can adjust to and use the improved technology. As a result, firms
may end up focusing too much on higher end high margin technology and leave the
low end open to competition. This is a similar argument to Christensen's
disruptive innovation model. Andy Grove called that lower end market the
"segment zero".

An example is Microsoft focusing on the operating system for the PC market. The
lower end OSs like Android and iOS that were originally meant for phones started
penetrating into tablets and Chromebooks.

Many high tech products exhibit networking effects ie the value of the product
increases non-linearly as the number of products sold increases. This effect is
more than just the cost scaling achieved as more products are sold. For
instance, as more people started using telephones, the value of having a
telephone increased because you could call more people. This can set up a
positive feedback loop where value increases leading more people to buy the
product leading to value increasing further.

Many high tech companies (software, pharmaceuticals) have high fixed costs and
low marginal costs. Changing from a high marginal cost company to a low marginal
cost company can increase profitability. Once it's in a low marginal cost
regime, its strategy should emphasize that structure ie drive down prices to
increase volume and maintain profitability.

First movers in an industry can have advantages and disadvantages. As an
advantage, they can strategically drive down costs quicker or build proprietary
technology to lock in customers faster. As a disadvantage, they may end up
spending a lot in marketing to sell the product in a new market. Second entrants
don't have to bear these costs.

* Globalization

Any firm looking to globalize faces two challenges that are conflicting:
pressures to reduce cost and pressures to customize for local markets. Even if
the firm starts with one strategy, it may have to switch in the face of
competition.

[[file:ENIMAGE1606307303284.jpg]]

* Business units

Business units can choose a strategy of horizontal or vertical integration.

Horizontal integration implies buying other companies that sell similar products
to yours.

The benefits of horizontal integration include:

- Lower cost structure :: Fixed costs can be spread across more units.
  For instance, Pfizer acquires smaller pharmaceutical companies to
  use the sales force more efficiently. Note that this assumes that
  there is some excess capacity present before that can be
  exploited. This can be a weak assumption.

- Product differentiation :: You can enrich your portfolio by
  providing multiple products. Eg Google offering to buy Groupon.

- Leveraging a competitive advantage more broadly eg. Walmart adding Sam's club.

- Reduced competition

- Better bargaining power with suppliers due to scale eg Sprint T-mobile merger.

However, managers tend to overestimate the benefits of a horizontal integration
and underestimate the costs and risks (new culture, loss of key employees, etc).

Vertical integration means moving into industries that provide you inputs
(backward vertical) or industries that use your outputs (forward vertical). Eg
IBM providing technology consulting services is forward vertical integration and
IBM getting into disk drive manufacturing for their servers is backward
vertical.

Vertical integration can help, for instance, if you need quality control in your
inputs that existing suppliers can't deliver. For example, McDonald's bought cow
farms in Russia to have tighter quality control over its beef. However, there
can be disadvantages to this approach when the technology is constantly
changing. For instance, Sony integrated backwards into CRT manufacture for its
TVs. As a result, though, it was late to capitalize on the shift to plasma TVs.

An alternative to vertical integration that can capture some of the value is
making strategic alliances. In the car industry, GM is known to do open bids for
short term contracts with suppliers and award the bid to the lowest cost
supplier. This can be a good strategy if the technology isn't changing and you
don't need tight JIT scheduling etc. However, it can fail if the supplier's
product quality is a competitive advantage because, with short term lowest cost
bids, the suppliers do not have incentives to put in place quality control
initiatives, cutting edge research etc.

Strategic alliances, in turn, can induce weakness in a strategic supplier
because they know that they have captive business. For this reason, usually
alliance contracts are for 3-5 years and renegotiated after that period. Also,
companies like Toyota usually have two strategic suppliers for any component.
This induces market discipline in the suppliers.

Strategic outsourcing has taken over as an option to vertical integration in
many cases. Firms outsource their non-value added activities to other suppliers
who specialize in that activity.

Quasi-vertical integration is also practiced where a firm makes cash investments
in machinery etc and provides it to a supplier in exchange for exclusive rights
to the manufactured products. Apple is known to use its cash balance in this
fashion.

* Corporate diversification

Product bundling does not always require diversification. It can be
achieved through contract agreements eg McDonald's can provide toys to its
customers by making contract agreements with toy manufacturers. It does not need
to buy a toy manufacturer.

In one form of related diversification, firms use existing competencies in an
industry (R&D, marketing etc.) to diversify into other industries where those
competencies can be used. Another form of related diversification is where a
corporate function can be utilized eg strategic R&D, organization design,
organizational strategic planning and thinking etc.

Unrelated diversification is use of capital that a firm has in order to invest
in an unrelated area. Firms are successful doing this only in countries where
investment is hard to come by.

A common misconception is that diversification allows a corporation to average
out performance over different business cycles. In fact, stockholders in the
company can do that diversification by themselves in a more efficient manner
than the company can. So, it may be better for the company to pay the profits
back to its stockholders.

* Corporate governance and ethics

The company has multiple stakeholders. The picture below shows how a firm
services each stakeholder.

[[file:Corp_governance_1.png]]

Principal/agent problem: The principal (e.g. stockholders) elect an
agent (e.g.  the CEO) to take actions on their behalf. Since the agent
is involved in the day-to-day operation, they have more information
than the principal, leading to an information asymmetry that they can
take advantage of for selfish reasons. This can continue down the
chain from CEO to GMs of BUs to managers.

Governance is introduced to mitigate the principal/agent problem. For
instance, the Board of Directors can play this role. The Board generally
consists of inside directors such as the CEO and outside directors who are not
full-time employees.

Another method for governance is to grant stock options at a pre-determined
strike price.

* The balanced scorecard

The building blocks of competitive advantage are efficiency, quality, customer
responsiveness, and innovation.

Internal governance can be done through a balanced scorecard that
covers these building blocks in addition to the lagging indicator of
financials.

Financial perspective: ROIC, revenue etc.

Customer perspective: quality, time to respond, customer satisfaction/delight
etc.

Internal perspective: quality, efficiency, employee satisfaction/delight etc.

Innovation/learning: Number of patents, number/percent of new products
introduced, time to market for new products, etc.

* Good and bad strategy                                              :Review:

There are three main pathways to bad strategy - choosing to do many
things rather than a few focused things, using templatized
mission statements rather than doing the hard work of understanding
the key problems to solve, and assuming that a positive mindset or
hard work is enough.

A strategy consists of three elements - a problem diagnosis, a guiding
policy, and a set of actions based on the policy.

A diagnosis replaces the complex reality with a simpler story about
the crucial aspects of the problem.

Every organization faces a situation where the full complexity and
ambiguity of the situation is daunting. An important duty of any
leader is to absorb a large part of that complexity and ambiguity,
passing on to the organization a simpler problem that is solvable.

A hallmark of true expertise and insight is making a complex subject
understandable. A hallmark of mediocrity and bad strategy is
unnecessary complexity.

A strategy is actually a design rather than a decision. It transforms
goals (which are overall desires) to objectives (which are operational
targets).
