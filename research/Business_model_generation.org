* Business model canvas                                              :Review:

  A business model describes the rationale of how an organization
  creates, delivers and captures value.

  The [[file:Screenshot 2022-03-23 151920.jpg][building blocks]] of a business model are as follows.


** Customer segments

   An organization may serve one or several small or large customer
   segments. Separate customer segments may be formed if that segment
   needs distinct products, are reached through different channels,
   require different relationships, have different profitabilities or
   different revenues.


** Value propositions

   There may be many value propositions that an organization provides
   Some examples are
   - Newness i.e. products that haven't existed before
   - Brand i.e. value in the act of using a brand
   - Design
   - Accessibility, for instance, mutual funds allow investors with
     modest investments to have access to a wider range of stocks than
     previously possible.

** Channels (for communication, distribution, and sales)

   Companies should use a mix of owned channels and partner
   channels to reach their customers. The channel strategy should be
   integrated across [[file:Screenshot 2022-03-23 110022.jpg][all types of channels]] to reach the right customer
   mix.


** Customer relationships

   Customers may look for a varied extent of customer relations
   e.g. self-service, dedicated personal assistance, communities,
   co-creation etc.


** Revenue streams


** Key resources

   What key resources will the company use to support the business
   model? e.g. intellectual property, brand, people etc.

   See also discussion of the [[file:Business_strategy.org][VRIO resource framework]].


** Key activities


** Key partnerships

   Who are the key suppliers, co-creators etc.? Who provides key
   resources for your firm?


** Cost structure

   What are the key cost drivers? Is your firm a high-value
   proposition like exclusive hotels or is it a cost-effective
   proposition?
