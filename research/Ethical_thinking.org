* Practical Ethics by Peter Singer

  Preference utilitarianism says that, if a person has a preference,
  then that preference should not be tampered with, all other things
  being equal. All people have a preference to stay alive, desires that
  they want to fulfill etc. So, killing them is not acceptable. (John
  Harsanyi suggests an amendment of manifest preference vs innate or
  natural preference. For instance, someone may outwardly suggest a
  preference for something irrational or based on faulty logic. That
  person may act upon that personal preference. However, when
  considering social utility, you should consider the innate or natural
  preference.)

  We can assume such preferences exist for beings that are aware of
  themselves and have an image of themselves in the past, present and
  future. Note that, for instance, a fish doesn't necessarily have this
  self-image. However, it may still struggle when it's about to
  die. That's self-preservation which is separate from having a
  self-image in the future.

  For self-aware beings with a sense of past, present and future and a
  set of preferences, it may not be ok to kill such a person even if you
  introduce a new person with preferences. On the other hand, for a
  being with no sense of time and self-image, it may be OK to kill such
  a person if you substitute with another person who also has
  preferences and if the killing can be done instantaneously without
  suffering.

  This raises the question of when it is OK to kill a person. If the person
  has explicitly declared that they would like to be killed, then
  euthanasia should be allowed based on preference utilitarianism. It
  should also be allowed based on other philosophical models like rights
  (the living person has a right to life and an option to give up that
  right). This is voluntary euthanasia.

  If the person has not requested death but it is clear that they will
  face intense and irredeemable pain and suffering, then euthanasia
  should be ethical if the person who administers it has done a
  probabilistic calculation that leads to this conclusion. On the flip
  side, it is unethical to let such a person die passively (through
  non-intervention) if that causes significant suffering. Just as, if a
  dog is in distress, we may take it to the vet to administer a lethal
  injection, so also, if a baby suffers an incurable disease that is
  guaranteed to cause lifelong suffering, it should be ethical to kill the
  baby.

  The one case in which this would be unethical is if the person had
  expressed a desire to continue to live. In that case, that person's
  preferences take precedence.

  Contrary to popular opinion, a human life may not always be worth
  living.

  John Locke and Robert Nozick argue from a theory of rights ie the
  right against interference. By their argument, everyone has a right
  against interference from others but not a right to assistance from
  others. However, this may not hold due to problems like buying
  resources from despots, global warming and purchasing products the
  manufacture of which causes suffering to others.


* The Life you can save by Peter Singer

  10% of the world's population lives in extreme poverty (< $2/day) as
  of 2015. 85% lives on $30 or less per day.

  If you can reduce the suffering of one other person without much
  suffering for yourself, you should do so. Giving aid to charitable
  organizations that work with poor people will help alleviate their
  suffering. So, you must give as much money as you can spare to such
  organizations. Anything less can be considered unethical.

  In FY19, [[https://explorer.usaid.gov/][US foreign aid]] was $49B and US GDP was $2T. So, foreign aid
  was roughly 2.5% of GDP.  The US is one of the highest contributors of
  donations in absolute numbers but it is one of the lowest contributors
  as a percentage of GDP or income. A lot of this aid goes to countries
  that the US has political interests in and are not the poorest
  countries in the world. A large part of the poorest people in the
  world live in South Asia and in sub-Saharan Africa. Our charitable
  donations should go to them.

  A donation of $50 can help with avoidable problems like cataracts. A
  donation of $3000 san save a life in a poor country. A donation of
  $2/year can bring chlorinated water to one poor person. In contrast,
  the cost of saving a life in the US is estimated at $2M.

  According to [[https://givingusa.org/giving-usa-2020-charitable-giving-showed-solid-growth-climbing-to-449-64-billion-in-2019-one-of-the-highest-years-for-giving-on-record/][Giving USA]], in 2020, private donors (individuals,
  foundations, companies) in the US gave $470B in charity. Out of that,
  giving to international affairs was about $20B. That amounts to about
  $1600/year of total charity per person and $70/year of international
  charity. People generally prefer to give to causes that are dear to
  their heart and not necessarily to causes that bring the most value.

  A [[https://howrichami.givingwhatwecan.org/how-rich-am-i?income=200000&countryCode=USA&household%5Badults%5D=2&household%5Bchildren%5D=2][US household income]] of $200k for a family of four can put you in the
  top 1% of the world. Donating 10% of your income still keeps you in
  the top 1% and potentially saves about 20 human lives/year.

  People in rich countries are already doing harm to those in poor
  countries eg through global warming, buying goods from companies that
  bribe officials to gain resources from poor countries, blocking
  immigration and trade from other countries etc. The US subsidizes its
  own farmers and applies tariffs on imports from other countries, thus
  making it harder for farmers from poor countries to sell their goods
  here.

  Generally speaking, you should not give money to poor people directly
  because it may cause dependence. Instead, money should be spent on
  organizations that provide healthcare, education, housing etc.

  People do things based on what other people in their peer group are
  doing. So, if you're doing something moral like going vegetarian or
  donating a large part of your income to charity, you should announce
  it publicly and talk about it so that your peers are induced to do the
  same.

  People already show altruism in some forms eg leaving tips in
  restaurants that they may never go back to. However, more altruism
  needs to be directed to the world's poorest people.

  Warren Buffett donated a large part of his income after he became a
  billionaire. It would have been a mistake if he had donated the first
  million he made because then he wouldn't be able to donate billions in
  later life. However, not all of us are expert investors like
  Buffett. Most of us should donate money now rather than later, because
  the benefit of a lesser sum now outweighs the benefit of a slightly
  larger sum later.

  Instead of giving a small amount of charity and using the rest of the
  money for discretionary expenses, we should be cutting out many
  discretionary expenses and giving more to charity.

  There are many reasons why it's not in human nature to give to poor
  people on the other side of the world: no identifiable victim,
  parochialism in generosity, illusion of futility, notion of fairness,
  distributed responsibility etc.

  Economists like William Easterly have argued that giving aid can be a wasteful
  effort. However, this is usually concerned with large donors such as
  governments, World Bank etc. An individual or a group's donations are
  unlikely to be affected by this. However, individuals should try to
  find the best use of their money through reasonable study.

  Moral consequentialist theory may suggest that you should save a
  reasonable amount for your discretionary expenses and donate
  everything else. However, in the real world, people seldom implement
  such extreme measures. So, advocating for such extreme measures are
  unlikely to succeed. Further, this may not hold true in the
  deontological view.

  Even donating 5-10% of your net income and spreading the word to
  others can make a significant difference. There is higher chance of
  adoption of this level too.


* Effective Altruism

  Ajeya Cotra has a heart-felt introduction to [[https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/YCa8BRQoxKbmf5CJb/p/5EqJozsDdHcF7dpPL][effective altruism]].


** Why you should maximize your impact

  The average doctor in the UK may add about 150 healthy
  years over their career. The World Bank has a conversion rate of one
  life for every 30 healthy years, so a doctor in a developed country
  can save about 5 human lives over the course of their career.

  Some doctors have had 100,000 times that much impact in their lives
  e.g. the doctors who helped eradicate small-pox. Similarly, the
  Soviet bureaucrat [[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-24280831][Stanislav Petrov]] may have saved a billion lives by refusing to
  launch nuclear missiles according to protocol. Some of this was luck
  but, by making choices of which areas you focus on, you can get
  100-1000 times the impact of an average person in your field.

  You can [[https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/YCa8BRQoxKbmf5CJb/p/hk9Xh6xK5j3SQmkcn][increase your benefit to society]] in one of three ways.
    - Helping more people
    - Helping the same number of people to a greater extent, or
    - Doing something which has benefits that last for a longer time.


** The world is much better and can be much better

   All three of the following are true.
     - The world is much better
     - The world is awful
     - The world can be much better

   However, according to the [[http://www.fao.org/3/ca9692en/online/ca9692en.html#][State of Food Security report]] in 2020,
   the number of undernourished has been going up since 2014. In 2020,
   nearly 700 million people or about 9% of the world population
   were hungry. This number has been increasing since 2014 and COVID
   has the potential to make the trend worse. Most of the world's
   hungry population are in Asia and Africa.


* Poor Economics by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo

Poor people don't generally want more food. In many cases, giving them
grain etc is not helpful. Instead, providing more micronutrients,
iron, iodine etc may be more helpful.

Immunization is often not successful. This may be because poor people
don't easily see the benefits of long term interventions like
immunization. They may also distinguish between diseases that they use
traditional healing versus ones for which they see a doctor. However,
sometimes these beliefs are not strongly held. A little incentive
(some dal for each immunization and a set of stainless steel plates to
complete the course) can overcome it.

We naturally tend to postpone small costs and discount the benefits
that may accrue from them. The reverse holds for rewards. This is
called time inconsistency. Small incentives like the one above can
compensate for time inconsistency effects. While such nudges sound
paternalistic, the truth is that even citizens in developed countries
need such nudges and take them for granted. For instance, we get our
kids vaccinated because, if not, schools won't accept them. We go to
gyms partly because our insurance subsidizes it.

Although poor people could generally benefit from risk insurance, t
they generally don't buy it. Some of this may be due to the nature of
product (you post for something that you hope you never use). Trust in
the insurance agent may also be a factor.

Microfinance institutions work reasonably well but are not
transformative. They rely on strict loan repayment rules and usually
lend to a group of people. The group emerges through social pressure
that everyone in the group makes payments on time. Due to these strict
rules, it's harder for example to borrow for health related
emergencies where people may not be able to pay back
immediately. Moneylenders continue tu operate k and charge much higher
interests even in areas where such insuring are active.
