* CO2 emissions due to driving                                       :Review:

The following data on CO2 emissions due to delivered power and gas
consumption is from the [[https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gases-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references][EPA website]].

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
# Kg of CO2 per gallon of gas consumed
f1 = 8.9

# The Toyota RAV4 hybrid efficiency in gallons/mile
f2 = 1/40

# Assume 10,000 miles/year
f5 = 10**4

print("1 year in the RAV4 hybrid causes %.2f tons of CO2" % (f1*f2*f5/1000))

# Kg of CO2 per kWatt-hr of power delivered
f3 = 950*(4/9)*(1/1000)*(1/(1 - 0.073))

# The Toyota RAV4 Prime's battery efficiency in kWatt-hours/mile
f4 = 18/48

print("1 year of battery only in the RAV4 Prime causes %.2f tons of CO2" % (f3*f4*f5/1000))

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 1 year in the RAV4 hybrid causes 2.23 tons of CO2
: 1 year of battery only in the RAV4 Prime causes 1.71 tons of CO2


* CO2 emissions from flights                                         :Review:

From [[https://ourworldindata.org/travel-carbon-footprint][Our World in data]],

#+NAME: flight_table
|--------------------------+---------------------|
| Type of flight           | Grams of CO2 per km |
|--------------------------+---------------------|
| Domestic short-haul      |                 255 |
| International (economy)  |                 150 |
| International (business) |                 434 |
|--------------------------+---------------------|

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :var tab = flight_table
# Assume a certain distance in miles flown per year
# One-way distance from Boston, MA to Chennai, India is 8000 miles
# One-way distance from Boston, MA to Chicago, IL is 1000 miles
miles_per_year = [3000, 15000]

total_CO2 = 0
for f_type in range(len(miles_per_year)):
   # Convert table data from km to miles
   total_CO2 = total_CO2 + miles_per_year[f_type] * tab[f_type+1][1] * 1.6

print("Tons of CO2 per year from flying = %.2f" % (total_CO2/(1e6)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Tons of CO2 per year from flying = 4.82


* CO2 emissions from container shipping                              :Review:

From a [[https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/UCL_ship_efficiency_forICCT_2013.pdf][report published by the University College of London]], the
following table shows CO2 emissions from various kinds of container
ships. The Normalized Operational Efficiency (NOE) may be the
appropriate metric to use.

* Plant-based diets                                                  :Review:

   From [[https://ourworldindata.org/carbon-opportunity-costs-food][Our World in Data]], plant-based diets have the best properties
   of opportunity cost (saved agricultural land can be converted into
   forests to act as carbon sinks) and GHG reductions. However,
   removing meat and milk from the diet (keeping eggs and fish) gets
   you most of the improvements.

   [[./Screenshot 2021-08-01 121119.png]]

   Plant-based diets are better than meat-based diets even when you
   [[https://ourworldindata.org/less-meat-or-sustainable-meat?country=][normalize for protein production]].


* Contribution of various stages of food production                  :Review:

  Food production accounts for 25% of GHG emissions (CO2, CH4 and
  N2O). Within food production, land use change (converting grasslands
  to agricultural land) and farm-stage processes (fertilizer
  application and methane generated in the bellies of cows) account
  for a majority of GHG emission. All stages after the farm account
  for 10% or less (see [[./Screenshot Environmental impact.png][this picture]]). So, "eating local" doesn't help
  with GHGs. Removing meat and milk-based products as seen in
  [[Plant-based diets]] does help.

  The only exception is that you shouldn't eat
  air-freighted foods: those tend to be foods that need to stay fresh
  and come from a far distance. However, it is hard to know which ones
  those are and they tend to be rare.
