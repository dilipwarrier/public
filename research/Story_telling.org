* Why is story telling important?                                 :Review:

The map is not the terrain. Most importantly, it's a conceptual
framework.

When we say something that's compelling but not true, we
dupe our audience. That may work for a while but, sooner or later, we
will get caught. However, when we say something that's both
interesting and true, we go beyond the facts and create a
powerful story. We must always aim to create such a story.
