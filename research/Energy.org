The US AI power growth represents 34% y-o-y growth from 2025
through 2030.

** Reasons for trending changes in data centers

Until 2022, data centers focused on general-purpose
computing. However, after the introduction of ChatGPT, the focus has
shifted towards high-performance computing.

Data transfers between GPUs is still a bottleneck in high-performance
computing. To avoid this, GPUs are now crowded closer to each
other. So, GPUs are getting crowded into servers. Servers in turn are
getting crowded into racks.

In 2022, Nvidia had 8 GPUs in a server. In 2024, it had a rack that
could operate as a single server with 144 GPUs but it requires 10x the
power of a specific rack. In 2027, Nvidia will deliver a system with
576 GPUs in a single rack requiring 600 kW of power. We are trending
towards 1 MW per rack. This is 50x the power density per rack of 2020.

Heat management is also a significant concern. Air cooling cannot
handle this level of heat generation. Liquid cooling is needed
instead.

The infrastructure systems in data centers are fast evolving. This, in
turn, means fast obsolescence for infrastructure. Companies cannot
assume that their capital investments will have a 10-year life cycle.

When mobile phones first launched, they incorporated infrastructure
from the PC and MP3 player industry. However, pretty quickly, the
mobile phone market outstripped the PC market and led to its own
supply chain creation. As a result, TSMC far overtook Intel in chip
production capability.

Similarly, the switch from traditional cloud centers to
high-performance compute based data centers may create its own supply
chain with its own set of winners and losers.

* US energy consumption                                              :Review:

The [[https://www.eia.gov/beta/states/overview][EIA web site]] shows energy consumption by state. Most US states
have a significant consumption of non-renewable sources of energy such
as natural gas and petroleum.

See [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mgCN8V5FYhhD-obrXtLrbDzbbZWOd58R/view?usp=drive_link][this picture from 2023]] for details.

In 2024, [[https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/data/browser/#/?id=1-AEO2025&region=0-0&cases=ref2025&start=2023&end=2035&f=A&linechart=~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ref2025-d032025a.3-1-AEO2025~ref2025-d032025a.4-1-AEO2025~ref2025-d032025a.5-1-AEO2025~ref2025-d032025a.6-1-AEO2025~ref2025-d032025a.7-1-AEO2025~ref2025-d032025a.8-1-AEO2025~ref2025-d032025a.9-1-AEO2025~ref2025-d032025a.10-1-AEO2025~ref2025-d032025a.11-1-AEO2025~ref2025-d032025a.12-1-AEO2025&ctype=linechart&chartindexed=0&sourcekey=0][US energy (production plus imports minus exports)]] will be at
about 38 PetaWatt-hours (PWh). US energy consumption will be at about
28 PWh. This is the reference case that considers nominal growth
rates.

[[id:6af95639-5f7a-4eb2-b2b1-fa3b05f5cc75][Total data center consumption]] of 220 TWh is 0.8% of total US
consumption in 2024.

[[id:cb7304cc-fee3-4d94-b021-7c56b6620c34][Solar power generation]] at 250 GWh is a small fraction of total US
energy production in 2024.


** Why is data center consumption such a big deal if it's a small percentage of total power? :Ideas:


** Power consumption of an average US home
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       d51a7c0d-0649-40cf-b9fb-29e759f4ea6a
:END:

  An average US home consumes about 1 kW of power. Since a year has
  about 9000 hours, that translates to 9 MWh/year of consumption.


* Solar power generation

:END:

- As of 2024, California remains the national leader in solar generation, showing
  steady year-over-year growth.
- Texas has emerged as a fast-growing solar state, with generation
  increasing more than threefold between 2019 and 2023.
- Florida continues to expand solar capacity, although 2023 saw a
  slight decline.
- Together, these three states accounted for over half of U.S. solar
  generation in 2023, though their collective share has declined
  slightly as solar expands nationwide.

| 2021 | 164.0 (23.3%)      | 62.0 (8.8%)          | 24.0 (50.0%)    | 14.0 (33.3%)      | 61.0 (-2.9%)  |
| 2020 | 133.0 (25.5%)      | 57.0 (7.5%)          | 16.0 (70.2%)    | 10.5 (28.0%)      | 62.8 (-5.7%)  |
| 2019 | 106.0              | 53.0                 | 9.4             | 8.2               | 66.6          |
|------+--------------------+----------------------+-----------------+-------------------+---------------|

These numbers are a combination of residential and commercial energy
generation.

On average, a US home can generate 6 MWh/year of solar energy. Compare
that with average [[id:d51a7c0d-0649-40cf-b9fb-29e759f4ea6a][US household energy consumption]] of 9 MWh/year.
