* EV global market trends                                            :Review:


** S&P Mobility Dec 2024

   S&P Mobility predicts that US BEV sales will only be at 5M
   units in 2030, down from a previous projection of 6.5M. This means
   BEVs will only account for 30% of a total US auto sales of about
   16M.


** Goldman Sachs report June 2024

   [[file:Screenshot 2024-06-01 122638.png]]

   This [[https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/why-are-ev-sales-slowing.html][report]] argues that the bear case for EVs is more likely. The
   bear case is that BEVs will account for 25M (25% of world-wide
   market) in 2030. The hyper-adoption case was that EVs would
   account for 45M (45% of world-wide market) in 2030. The
   hyper-adoption case in the GS article is the same as the numbers in
   the EV Volumes case below.

   Roughly 10M EVs were sold in 2022. So, this is a CAGR of 12% up
   to 2030. The CAGR for the hyper-adoption case is 21%.

   According to the [[https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/electric-car-registrations-and-sales-share-in-china-united-states-and-europe-2018-2023][IEA 2024 outlook]], a total of 13.8M BEVs + PHEVs
   were sold world-wide. Those numvers were 8.1M in China, 3.3M for
   Europe, and 1.4M for US.

   From [[#EV_Volumes_2023][EV Volumes 2023]], the world total was 10.5M in 2022. That's
   still a 30% increase.

   According to [[https://www.ev-volumes.com/country/total-world-plug-in-vehicle-volumes/][EV Volumes]], about 10.5M EVs were sold globally
   in 2022. This was 13% of all passenger vehicles. Out of this, about
   7.5M were BEVs and about 3M were PHEVs. By 2030, the
   number is expected to be at 46M (about 45% of the total light
   vehicle market).

   According to slide 22 of the [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PbKV4vZi1Ss7P7m10blSwGAeI1459bPc/view][Battery Health Report]], about 6.2M EVs were sold in
   China (about 60% of the global market), 2.7M in Europe and 1.1M were
   sold in the US. This was a 55% increase from 2021.

   The total car sales (BEV, PHEV, ICE, etc.) in the US in CY23 is estimated
   to be at about 15M. This is down from a high in CY19 (pre-pandemic)
   of about 17M. In CY23, [[https://www.coxautoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Q4-2023-Kelley-Blue-Book-Electric-Vehicle-Sales-Report.pdf][1.2M BEVs were sold]] in the US and, in CY22,
   0.8M BEVs were sold.


* EV charging                                                        :Review:

  A standard AC socket in the US (120 V, 15 A) can give about 1.8 kW of
  power. A Level 2 charger (240 V, 30 A) can provide about 7.2 kW of
  power.

  DC fast chargers (Level 3) can provide up to 150 kW of power. For a
  70 kWh battery, that implies full charge in about 30 min. The same
  full charge would take 10 hours on a level 2 charger.

  An average US home consumes about 1 kW of power, so a DC fast
  charger is equivalent to about 150 homes at its peak charging. Even
  a level 2 charger is equivalent to about 7 US homes.


* EV charging station market trends                                  :Review:


  US charging stations can be located using [[https://afdc.energy.gov/stations#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC][this DoE site]].

  As of Dec 1st, there were 12k public DCFCs and 60k public L2s in the
  US.

  There's a discrepancy between this data and the IEA data that shows
  100k public slow chargers in the US. Perhaps, the DoE count is less
  because it only counts live chargers.

  [[file:research/Screenshot 2022-03-04 144459.jpg][Automotive market]] is dominant for lithium ion batteries.

  Important factors for batteries are [[file:research/Screenshot 2022-03-05 141417.jpg][energy density]], power density, life span, cost and
  safety.

  The aim is to reduce cobalt usage in battery cathodes. [[file:research/Screenshot 2022-03-05 141932.jpg][Nickel]] is used
  quite a bit.

  The next generation technology is solid state. [[file:research/Screenshot 2022-03-05 142245.jpg][Lithium metal anode]] may
  still be required though for high energy density. However, you lose
  the lithium metal during discharge and get it back during charging.

  The advantages of solid state are higher energy density and improved
  safety because there is no flammable liquid. However, the lithium metal may
  increase costs.

  Various OEMs have different strategies for [[file:research/Screenshot 2022-03-05 142658.jpg][energy density]]. Lithium
  metal anodes have the highest energy density (350-500 Wh/kg) while
  Gr/Si anodes have 250-300 Wh/kg.

  [[file:research/Screenshot 2022-03-05 171057.jpg][Lifetime trend]]

  The [[https://cleantechnica.com/2018/09/29/nissans-long-strange-trip-with-leaf-batteries/][Nissan Leaf]] has had problems with the battery, especially in hot
  conditions. Older battery models do not have a Thermal Management
  System (TMS).


* Lithium carbonate                                                  :Review:

  Lithium carbonate is the main ingredient in lithium ion
  batteries. The demand for this chemical is expected to go up from
  600k tons on 2022 to 2.4M tons in 2030.

  Australia is the largest supplier with about 40% of the market. The
  triangle of Chile, Argentina and Bolivia have 66% of the world's
  lithium resources but have struggled to mine it properly.

* Lithium recycling                                                  :Review:

  There is a need to regenerate lithium and rare metals from batteries
  through recycling. The [[https://youtu.be/xLr0GStrnwQ][former CTO of Tesla]] has started a startup,
  Redwood Materials, aimed at this.


* Cold weather performance                                           :Review:

  In cold weather, ICE engines recirculate the heat radiated by the
  engines into the cabin to warm it up. In contrast, EV batteries are
  efficient and do not radiate as much heat. So, the cabin has to be
  heated up using EV battery energy. As a result, EV range drops
  significantly in winter conditions.

  Per [[https://electrek.co/2022/12/13/worried-about-winter-range-loss-see-how-over-a-dozen-evs-compare/][this article,]] most EVs lose ~20% range at freezing temperature
  compared to 70 degrees Fahrenheit.

* Cell types and counts                                              :Review:

  [[https://www.laserax.com/blog/ev-battery-cell-types][Pouch battery formats]] are most common in EVs. In this format, there
  are 100s of cells in an EV.

  The [[file:c:/Users/dwarr/Documents/GitHub/private/Battery_management_systems/Notes.org][Nissan Leaf]] has 48 2s2p battery modules = 192 cells for 24
  kWh. The Nissan Leaf e+ has 62 kWh and a configurable number of
  cells per module. However, it's not clear how many modules are in a
  pack. See [[https://www.nissan-global.com/EN/INNOVATION/TECHNOLOGY/ARCHIVE/LI_ION_EV/#:~:text=In%20the%20second%20generation%20LEAF,as%20standard%2C%20increasing%20filling%20efficiency.][Nissan page]].

* SoC and SoH estimation                                             :Review:

  According to [[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9036949][this paper]]:
  - SoC and SoH can be estimated to < 1% error through ML methods.
  - Most of the documented methods have not been validated against real-world EV data.
  - Most methods haven't used data at temperatures less than 0 degrees Celsius. All
  estimation methods will have challenges at those temperatures.


* Fault prediction                                                   :Review:

  According to [[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41226-5][this paper]]:
  Dynamical Auto-Encoding and Decoding (DyAD) is an effective method
  for predicting faults. They optimize for total inspection and
  maintenance costs. They also provide a large public dataset of
  charging snippets from three car brands.


* Battery aging                                                      :Review:


** DCFC effects on battery age

** Modes of aging

  [[https://www.accure.net/battery-knowledge/blog-battery-aging][Accure]]

  [[file:Screenshot 2023-10-03 114415.png][Typical battery aging profile]]

  Aging is caused by SEI (Surface Electrolyte Interface)
  formation. This forms on the graphite anode and accumulates over
  time, resulting in increased resistance.

  Biggest causes of accelerated aging are:
  - Temperature
    [[file:Screenshot 2023-10-03 115732.png][Aging due to temperature]]

  - High SoC
    [[file:Screenshot 2023-10-03 120047.png][Aging due to SoC]]

  - Number of cycles and average depth of discharge per cycle -> high
    average SoC -> aging
    [[file:Screenshot 2023-10-03 120242.png][Faster aging due to higher average DoD]]

  - Fast charging -> increased temperature -> aging


* Battery costs                                                      :Review:

  [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/13eYJbFfhuhuLLr7BQ0xGqkOMnjDv42LM/view?usp=drivesdk][IHS Markit report]] on battery costs

  Average BEV capacity will increase to roughly 70 kWh by 2030.

  Costs of batteries increase by chemistry from NCA to NMC to LFP.

  Costs for LFP will drop from $170/kWh in 2020 to $110/kWh in 2030.


* EV range                                                           :Review:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: EV_range
  :END:

  [[https://www.recurrentauto.com/news/real-world-range-for-tesla][Recurrent]], a company that does EV analytics, did an in-depth study
  of real-life range from EVs. It showed that, in real life, the Tesla
  Model S provides 90% of its EPA range at 90 deg F but only 50% of
  its EPA range at 30 deg F. However, the estimated range on the
  dashboard remains relatively constant at 90% of the EPA range at
  these temperatures. Thus, Tesla owners are promised a much higher
  range on the dashboard than they actually get.

  Other vehicle brands also show a variation in real-life range with
  temperature but none are as drastic as the Tesla.

  The article cautions, though, that newer Tesla models have heating
  pumps and advanced thermal management that may reduce this
  variation.



* EV fires                                                           :Review:
  According to [[https://spectrum.ieee.org/lithium-ion-battery-fires][IEEE Spectrum]], fires in batteries in EVs have a lower incidence rate
  than fires in vehicles in general.


* Automotive Tier-1 suppliers                                        :Review:

  [[https://www.autonews.com/live-blog/2023-top-auto-suppliers-giants-grow-new-era][In 2023]], Bosch was the largest Automotive Tier-1 with an annual
  revenue of $50B.
