  [[file:research/Screenshot 2022-03-04 144459.jpg][Automotive market]] is dominant for lithium ion batteries.

  Important factors for batteries are [[file:research/Screenshot 2022-03-05 141417.jpg][energy density]], power density, life span, cost and
  safety.

  The aim is to reduce cobalt usage in battery cathodes. [[file:research/Screenshot 2022-03-05 141932.jpg][Nickel]] is used
  quite a bit.

  The next generation technology is solid state. [[file:research/Screenshot 2022-03-05 142245.jpg][Lithium metal anode]] may
  still be required though for high energy density. However, you lose
  the lithium metal during discharge and get it back during charging.

  The advantages of solid state are higher energy density and improved
  safety because there is no flammable liquid. However, the lithium metal may
  increase costs.

  Various OEMs have different strategies for [[file:research/Screenshot 2022-03-05 142658.jpg][energy density]]. Lithium
  metal anodes have the highest energy density (350-500 Wh/kg) while
  Gr/Si anodes have 250-300 Wh/kg.

  [[file:research/Screenshot 2022-03-05 171057.jpg][Lifetime trend]]

  The [[https://cleantechnica.com/2018/09/29/nissans-long-strange-trip-with-leaf-batteries/][Nissan Leaf]] has had problems with the battery, especially in hot
  conditions. Older battery models do not have a Thermal Management
  System (TMS).


* Lithium carbonate

  Lithium carbonate is the main ingredient in lithium ion
  batteries. The demand for this chemical is expected to go up from
  600k tons on 2022 to 2.4M tons in 2030.

  Australia is the largest supplier with about 40% of the market. The
  triangle of Chile, Argentina and Bolivia have 66% of the world's
  lithium resources but have struggled to mine it properly.

* Lithium recycling

  There is a need to regenerate lithium and rare metals from batteries
  through recycling. The [[https://youtu.be/xLr0GStrnwQ][former CTO of Tesla]] has started a startup,
  Redwood Materials, aimed at this.


* Cold weather performance

  In cold weather, ICE engines recirculate the heat radiated by the
  engines into the cabin to warm it up. In contrast, EV batteries are
  efficient and do not radiate as much heat. So, the cabin has to be
  heated up using EV battery energy. As a result, EV range drops
  significantly in winter conditions.

  Per [[https://electrek.co/2022/12/13/worried-about-winter-range-loss-see-how-over-a-dozen-evs-compare/][this article,]] most EVs lose ~20% range at freezing temperature
  compared to 70 degrees Fahrenheit.

* EV global market trends


** Goldman Sachs report June 2024

   [[file:Screenshot 2024-06-01 122638.png]]

   This [[https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/why-are-ev-sales-slowing.html][report]] argues that the bear case for EVs is more likely. The
   bear case is that BEVs will account for 25M (25% of world-wide
   market) by 2030. The hyper-adoption case was that BEVs would
   account for 45M (45% of world-wide market) by 2030. The
   hyper-adoption case in the GS article is the same as the numbers in
   the EV Volumes case below.

   Roughly 10M EVs were sold in 2023. So, this is a CAGR of 14% up to 2030.

   The CAGRs for the base and hyper-adoption cases are 19% and 24%
   respectively.


** EV Volumes 2023

   According to [[https://www.ev-volumes.com/country/total-world-plug-in-vehicle-volumes/][EV Volumes]], about 10.5M EVs were sold globally
   in 2022. This was 13% of all passenger vehicles. Out of this, about
   7.5M were BEVs and about 3M were PHEVs. By 2030, the
   number is expected to be at 46M (about 45% of the total light
   vehicle market). This is an average growth rate of 21% every year
   for 8 years.

   [[file:Screenshot 2023-04-23 171648.png]]

   [[file:Screenshot 2023-12-07 130520.png]]

   According to slide 22 of the [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PbKV4vZi1Ss7P7m10blSwGAeI1459bPc/view][Battery Health Report]], about 6.2M EVs were sold in
   China (about 60% of the global market), 2.7M in Europe and 1.1m were
   sold in the US. This was a 55% increase from 2021.

   The total car sales (BEV, ICE etc.) in the US in CY23 is estimated
   to be at about 15M. This is down from a high in CY19 (pre-pandemic)
   of about 17M.

   Tesla expects to sell about 1.8M vehicles world-wide in CY23.


* Cell types and counts

  [[https://www.laserax.com/blog/ev-battery-cell-types][Pouch battery formats]] are most common in EVs. In this format, there
  are 100s of cells in an EV.

  The [[file:c:/Users/dwarr/Documents/GitHub/private/Battery_management_systems/Notes.org][Nissan Leaf]] has 48 2s2p battery modules = 192 cells for 24
  kWh. The Nissan Leaf e+ has 62 kWh and a configurable number of
  cells per module. However, it's not clear how many modules are in a
  pack. See [[https://www.nissan-global.com/EN/INNOVATION/TECHNOLOGY/ARCHIVE/LI_ION_EV/#:~:text=In%20the%20second%20generation%20LEAF,as%20standard%2C%20increasing%20filling%20efficiency.][Nissan page]].

  [[https://media.chevrolet.com/media/us/en/chevrolet/2022-bolt-euv-bolt-ev.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/feb/0214-boltev-bolteuv-specifications.html][Chevy Bolt]] EV and EUV have roughly 300 cells for 65 kWh.

  [[https://electricvehiclesfaqs.com/how-many-batteries-are-in-a-tesla-electric-car/#:~:text=The%20Tesla%20Model%203%20standard,groups%20(bricks)%20of%2031.][Tesla]] battery packs have 1000s of cells.


* SoC and SoH estimation

  According to [[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9036949][this paper]]:
  - SoC and SoH can be estimated to < 1% error through ML methods.
  - Most of the documented methods have not been validated against real-world EV data.
  - Most methods haven't used data at temperatures less than 0 degrees Celsius. All
  estimation methods will have challenges at those temperatures.


* Fault prediction

  According to [[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41226-5][this paper]]:
  Dynamical Auto-Encoding and Decoding (DyAD) is an effective method
  for predicting faults. They optimize for total inspection and
  maintenance costs. They also provide a large public dataset of
  charging snippets from three car brands.


* Battery aging

  [[file:Screenshot 2023-10-03 114415.png][Typical battery aging profile]]

  Aging is caused by SEI (Surface Electrolyte Interface)
  formation. This forms on the graphite anode and accumulates over
  time, resulting in increased resistance.

  Biggest causes of accelerated aging are:
  - Temperature
    [[file:Screenshot 2023-10-03 115732.png][Aging due to temperature]]

  - High SoC
    [[file:Screenshot 2023-10-03 120047.png][Aging due to SoC]]

  - Number of cycles and average depth of discharge per cycle -> high
    average SoC -> aging
    [[file:Screenshot 2023-10-03 120242.png][Faster aging due to higher average DoD]]

  - Fast charging -> increased temperature -> aging


* Battery costs

  [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/13eYJbFfhuhuLLr7BQ0xGqkOMnjDv42LM/view?usp=drivesdk][IHS Markit report]] on battery costs

  Average BEV capacity will increase to roughly 70 kWh by 2030.

  Costs of batteries increase by chemistry from NCA to NMC to LFP.

  Costs for LFP will drop from $170/kWh in 2020 to $110/kWh in 2030.


* EV range
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: EV_range
  :END:

  [[https://www.recurrentauto.com/news/real-world-range-for-tesla][Recurrent]], a company that does EV analytics, did an in-depth study
  of real-life range from EVs. It showed that, in real life, the Tesla
  Model S provides 90% of its EPA range at 90 deg F but only 50% of
  its EPA range at 30 deg F. However, the estimated range on the
  dashboard remains relatively constant at 90% of the EPA range at
  these temperatures. Thus, Tesla owners are promised a much higher
  range on the dashboard than they actually get.

  Other vehicle brands also show a variation in real-life range with
  temperature but none are as drastic as the Tesla.

  The article cautions, though, that newer Tesla models have heating
  pumps and advanced thermal management that may reduce this
  variation.


* EV fires

  According to [[https://spectrum.ieee.org/lithium-ion-battery-fires][IEEE Spectrum]], fires in batteries in EVs have a lower incidence rate
  than fires in vehicles in general.


* Automotive Tier-1 suppliers

  [[https://www.autonews.com/live-blog/2023-top-auto-suppliers-giants-grow-new-era][In 2023]], Bosch was the largest Automotive Tier-1 with an annual
  revenue of $50B.
