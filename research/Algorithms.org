** Optimal stopping or the secretary problem

The secretary problem was first presented by Martin Gardner in
Scientific American in a 1960s puzzle.

Assume you have a position for a secretary available. Assume further
that, if you can make an offer to a candidate, the candidate will
accept and that you can not go back and make an offer to a candidate
whom you rejected earlier. What is the optimal strategy you should
pursue? There is a theoretical answer: you should look at 37% of
candidates and, after that, make an offer to any candidate who is
better than the best candidate in that first 37%.
