Anything good takes five meetings to achieve, whether that be getting
a job, closing a deal, making a major change, or getting a date.

The flip side is also true: if it's taking a lot more than five
meetings, perhaps it's time to move on.

Roughly, the five meetings are as follows.
- The introduction :: Get to know each other, keep it 30 minutes tops.
- The story :: Tell your story.
  No embellishments but make it a good narrative. See also [[id:c252436c-dc01-41fd-8ee1-c2339323c36e][Explaining ideas]].
- The data :: Show your slide deck, your data, etc.
- The ask :: Pop the question but also pitch to a mutual friend.
  They are bound to ask that mutual friend who will then
  reinforce your story.
- The close :: Easy because you've had four touch points already.

Like all important concepts, this is easy to grasp but hard to follow.
