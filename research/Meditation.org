** My meditation practices

   I follow these themes largely derived from "Why Meditate?" by Matthieu Ricard.

   - Empathy with someone you hate :: Think about a person you have a
     difference of opinion with or a strong dislike for. Think about
     that person's spouse, parents, siblings, children and friends who
     care about them. Imagine those people and feel
     their love and kindness for that person.
   - The grandness of the universe :: Think about the entire universe
     as a system with stocks, flows, reinforcing and balancing loops
     and delays. Think of each of us as participants in that system
     along with our mental models, our ways of thinking as resulting
     from interactions within that system.
   - Tag a negative emotion :: When you feel a negative emotion, enter
     a micro-meditation. Tag the negative emotion, dwell on
     it. Consider it from all angles. Think about what would happen if
     your negative emotion were to come to full fruition e.g. if you
     got what you so ardently desired. Would you be genuinely happy or
     would you just get used to it?

** Scientific evidence

   From [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology][Wikipedia]]:

   In a Mindfulness article published in 2011 by Torbj√∂rn Josefsson,
   Pernilla Larsman, Anders G. Broberg, and Lars-Gunnar Lundh, it was
   found that meditation improves subjective well-being for
   individuals who mindfully meditate. The researchers note that
   being mindful in meditation includes awareness and observation of
   one's meditation practice, with non-reaction and non-judgmental
   sentiments during meditation.

** Contrarian views

   [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0216643][This study]] found potential ill-effects from meditation.
