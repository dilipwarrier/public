* Power ratings for charging

  A standard AC socket in the US (120 V, 15 A) can give about 1.8 kW of
  power. A Level 2 charger (240 V, 30 A) can provide about 7.2 kW of
  power.

  DC fast chargers (Level 3) can provide up to 150 kW of power. For a
  70 kWh battery, that implies full charge in about 30 min. The same
  full charge would take 10 hours on a level 2 charger.

  An average US home consumes about 1 kW of power, so a DC fast
  charger is equivalent to about 150 homes at its peak charging. Even
  a level 2 charger is equivalent to about 7 US homes.
