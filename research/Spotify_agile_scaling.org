  Squads are product teams that have all the skills necessary to
  develop some part of the product. They have a long-term vision. The
  product owner decides what the squad does and the squad decides how
  to do it. Squads are designed to be as self-contained as possible.

  Many squads together form a tribe which together produce some large
  piece of functionality. Typically, a tribe has about 100 people
  (Dunbar number).

  Chapters are typically people with the same technical skills across
  mutliple squads (but within one tribe). They are similar to
  functional groups in other organizations. The chapter lead is like a
  functional manager but the chapter lead is also in a squad, so the
  relation is looser.

  Guilds are a collection of people across multiple tribes with
  similar interests.
