** Qnovo

   Qnovo has a [[https://www.qnovo.com/news/borgwarner-and-ogci-climate-investments-complete-new-investments-in-qnovo-in-24m-series-c-funding][$24M Series-C funding]] from Borg-Warner among others.

   They build software for batteries but so far don't advertise any
   automotive products. They do software for consumer batteries like
   in cell phones.

   However, they had a [[https://mobex.io/webinars/nxp-semiconductors-and-qnovo-collaborate-on-xev-battery-performance/][joint webinar with NXP]] on improving EV
   performance.

  03:00 - Cloud software connected to high-performance embedded
          connected to edge
  14:00 - Tesla is very efficient in sending data back to the cloud
  16:00 - Need for microservices

  This web-based deployment from AWS is very similar to what they
  provide to Blackberry IVY.


* Software Defined Vehicles

   OEMs are looking for reduced costs of software integration (70% of
   software costs is in integration).

   This could be achieved through:
   - Zonal architectures where computing-intensive non-real-time
     tasks are done in general-purpose application processors as
     opposed to dedicated processors
   - Applications are written in higher-level languages and use
     off-the-shelf software components
   - Applications in the car communicate with applications in the cloud
     to provide maximum value
   - Applications are deployed as microservices through efficient
     cloud-based deployment and maintenance tools


** Trends                                                          :LinkedIn:

  While "software defined vehicles" is still a nebulous concept, a few
  key factors are clear.

  1. Processing distributed between applications in the cloud,
     microservices on application processors in the car and
     real-time critical software on edge sensors in the car
  2. Complexity on the edge reducing over time and moving to
     application processors in the middle
  3. Cloud configuration and maintenance of application software through
     over-the-air updates
  4. Capability to deploy new features and improve existing features
     over time
  5. More software in the car developed in higher-level programming
     languages rather than in C/C++.

  Here's a great discussion from CES 2023 by Munro live talking about
  all these. Note especially at the 3-min mark, the conversation about
  (1) and (2). Tools such as AWS Workbench will help simplify (3) and
  (4). Everything here makes sense and the economics is going to work
  in favor of these trends - higher labor supply for higher-level
  programming languages, reducing costs of application processors and
  carry-over from mobile phones, availability and growth of OSs like
  Android from the mobile industry, ease of deployment of AWS and
  other cloud platforms etc.

  Exciting times ahead for automotive software!
