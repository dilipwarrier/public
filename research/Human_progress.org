* Human progress                                                     :Review:

We are born into a pitiless universe, facing steep odds against
order. Entropy is merciless. We are in constant jeopardy of falling
apart. We were shaped by a force that is ruthlessly competitive. We are
vulnerable to illusions, self-centeredness, and astounding stupidity.

Yet, we are also endowed with the power to think up ideas and then
combine those ideas recursively. We have the capacity for sympathy. We
have an instinct for language and for using that language to form
connections.

We have found ways to magnify these powers through written, printed,
and electronic words. We have expanded our circle of sympathy through
a knowledge of history and the narrative arts. Our puny rational
faculties have been multiplied by the norms of reason: intellectual
curiosity, open debate, skepticism of authority, and the burden of
proof to verify ideas against reality.

Through these magnified powers, we eke out victories against the
forces that grind us down including the darker parts of our own
nature. We live longer, suffer less, learn more, and enjoy richer
experiences. Much suffering and peril remain. But, there is no limit
to the betterments we can attain if we apply knowledge to enhance
human progress.

* Rationality                                                        :Review:

Maybe it is reasonable in the 21st century for human beings to be more
anxious than previous generations. Maybe, there are important problems
such as global warming, the potential for nuclear disaster, etc that
previous generations didn't face and that we should worry about and
address. However, it is also true that the world is a better place
than it has ever been.

Most religions assume that there needs to be God or an afterlife for
human beings to be moral. However, if we conjure up a reason why God
is needed to ensure moral behavior, then we can just cut out the
middleman God and live by those ethics. This is not very convincing
though. Maybe you need an entity that has infinite memory or
afterlives where we will continue to play the same games we are
playing in this life to justify moralistic Nash equilibrium
behavior. However, those are also unrealistic assumptions, so this
doesn't justify religion or spirituality either.

Countries across the world are progressively becoming less religious
over time. The United States is more religious than any other
developed country in the Western hemisphere but, even in the US,
religious participation is declining over time.

This has primarily been due to the Enlightenment that turned away from
religion and towards humanism, reasoning, and problem-solving.

* Humanism                                                           :Review:

The American Humanist Association defines Humanism as follows.

"Humanism is a progressive philosophy of life that, without theism or
other supernatural beliefs, affirms our ability and responsibility to
lead ethical lives of personal fulfillment that aspire to the greater
good."

Their motto is "Good without a God".

Morality and ethics can be derived from an understanding of how human
evolution has progressed. Human beings do not need to assume the
existence of a supernatural entity to be moral. Morality arises from
evolution through kin selection, etc.

* The scientific method                                              :Review:

The scientific method alone is not a replacement for religion since it
does not address human needs. Human needs arise from evolution - the
need for kinship, impact, leisure, health, wealth, etc.

Remember your math: An anecdote is not a trend.

Remember your history: Just because something is bad today doesn't
mean it was better yesterday. Just because something is good today
doesn't mean it was that good yesterday.

Remember your philosophy: One cannot reason that there is no such
thing as reason.

Keep some perspective: Not every problem is a crisis.
