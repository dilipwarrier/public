* Marketing management by Philip Kotler                              :Review:

To be useful, market segments must be measurable, substantial (large
enough to be profitably served), differentiable (one segment is
different enough from another) and actionable (segment can be
effectively attracted and served).

In 2000, the following picture held.  If the world were a village of
1000 people, it would consist of 520 women and 480 men. 330 children
and people over age 65. 10 college graduates and 335 illiterate
adults. 52 North Americans, 95 Europeans and 584 Asians. 165 people
would speak Mandarin, 86 English and 83 Hindi.  There would be 329
Christians, 178 Muslims, and 132 Hindus.

Successful companies recognize and respond profitably to unmet needs
and trends. A trend is different from a fad: it has longevity, is
observable across several market areas and consumer activities and is
consistent with other significant indicators emerging at the same
time.

The available market for the product is the set of consumers who have
interest, income and access to that product.

Marketing information systems are required so that companies can make
more data-based decisions with more reliable information. For
instance, Coca-Cola knows how many ice cubes the average consumer
likes to have in a glass and at what temperature the average consumer
likes their can dispensed from a vending machine.

SWOT analysis is useful to identify (internal) strengths and
weaknesses and match them with (external) opportunities (new product
ideas) and threats (competitors, economy, cultural trends etc.)

Honeywell asks each department to rate its own strengths and
weaknesses and those of the other departments with which it interacts.

Winning companies have achieved superior in-company capabilities, not
just core competencies. Core competencies may exist within departments
e.g. Bose engineering, but we must develop competitive capabilities in
specific processes e.g. New product development.  (see similar note by
Michael Porter on strategy)

A core competency has three characteristics:
  - It is a source of competitive advantage in that it makes a
    significant contribution to perceived customer benefits.
  - It has a breadth of applications to a wide variety of markets.
  - It is difficult for competitors to imitate.

A definition of quality is "the totality of features and
characteristics of a product that determine its ability to satisfy
stated or implied needs". Note the emphasis on stated and implied
needs.

It is important to distinguish between conformance quality and
performance quality. A Mercedes-Benz has performance quality but even
a Hyundai may have conformance quality.

A business must be a user-satisfying process and not a goods-producing
process. For instance, Xerox is in the business of improving employee
productivity and not in the business of making copying equipment.

Five stage model of the customer buying process:
1. Problem recognition
2. Information search
3. Evaluation of alternatives
4. Purchase decision
5. Post-purchase behavior

Usually, customers exhibit complex buying behavior when the product is
expensive, bought infrequently, risky, and highly self-expressive,
like an automobile. Also, there are usually significant differences
between brands in this case. A complex buying behavior involves a
three-step process: develop beliefs about the product, develop
attitudes about the product, make a thoughtful choice.

For products sold to businesses, the orientation of the purchasing
departments of those businesses need to be considered. Their
orientation may be:
1. Tactical when the focus is commodification and multi sourcing.
2. Procurement orientation when the focus is joint quality improvement and cost reduction.
3. Supply chain management orientation when the focus of purchasing is to be a strategic value addition operation.

The orientation may depend on the type of product being acquired. The
product has two dimensions: amount of value or cost to the supplier
and amount of risk of supply.

Today's economy has a lot of surplus as opposed to deficit (eg a
toothpaste from just one company in 10 flavors). This implies hyper
competition for the suppliers and over choice for the
consumer. However, companies are guilty of strategy convergence and
lack of differentiation. Companies must successfully differentiate
themselves based on a coherent strategy.

All marketing strategy is based on segmentation, targeting and
positioning.  A company segments the market based on needs and groups,
targets those needs that it can satisfy in a superior way and
positions its offering so that the market recognized it distinctively.

The end result of positioning is a value proposition, a cogent reason
why the target market should buy the product.

Treacy and Wiersema propose three value disciplines: product
leadership, operational excellence and customer intimacy. A firm
should become the best in one of these value disciplines and achieve
adequate performance in the other two.

Generally, market experts recommend positioning 1 to 2 benefits. One
benefit if the market is new. However, the auto market is mature, so
Volvo might position itself as safer and more durable. However,
positioning more benefits is harder because the customer may not
believe you and the clear positioning is lost.
