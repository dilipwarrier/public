* Interview

  ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS!!

  Key questions to ask the interviewer are:
    - Users/customers
    - Scale (# of reads and writes)
    - Performance (latency etc.)
    - Cost (# of servers etc.)

  How do we write a user story about the specific use case?

  SQL database (e.g. mySQL) versus noSQL (Apache Cassandra, MongoDB)

  Normalized database => information is stored in one SQL database only and
  links are provided in other database tables.
