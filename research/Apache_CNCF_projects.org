* Apache and CNCF

CNCF addresses runtime infrastructure. It answers the question: How
do we run and observe cloud applications safely, reliably, and portably?

Apache addresses data and compute frameworks. It answers the question:
How do we move, transform, and analyze data efficiently and scalably?

You can think of CNCF tools as horizontal enablers, and Apache tools
as vertical data capabilities. In cloud-native data platforms, you
often run Apache tools on CNCF infrastructure.

* Apache Spark
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       be4c0342-3c8d-49ac-8046-f36b65361d72
:END:

See [[id:c63978d7-17dd-49e9-a52f-2fb47c7190c3][What is Apache Spark?]]

* Apache Cassandra

Distributed, highly scalable NoSQL database

Optimized for OLTP (online transactional processing):

High write throughput

Low-latency reads

Time-series and event workloads

Always-on availability

Rows stored in SSTables on disk

Queryed via CQL (Cassandra Query Language)

Used when you need fast, operational data access.

Examples:

IoT event ingestion

Time-series dashboards

User profile storage

Sensor data

Fraud scoring systems

* Apache Iceberg

A table format that sits on top of a data lake (S3, HDFS, GCS, Azure Blob)

Not a database - it tracks structured tables stored as Parquet/ORC files

Built for OLAP (analytical workloads):

Large-scale scans

ACID transactions in the data lake

Schema evolution

Partitioning

Time travel

Versioning

Queried via engines like Spark, Trino, Flink, Dremio, Snowflake (Iceberg tables)

Used when you need large-scale analytics on massive datasets.

Examples:

ML feature stores

Batch analytics

ETL pipelines

BI dashboards

Data warehouses built on S3 ("lakehouses")

* Apache Airflow

Apache Airflow is an open-source platform for developing, scheduling,
and monitoring batch-oriented workflows. It generates a Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) to specify a workflow. It is written in pure Python.

Kubernetes takes care of executing each of the tasks specified by Airflow.

* CNCF Knative
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       102ddbb5-4948-47e6-9526-8c364ada9fdb
:END:

Knative is a CNCF project with IBM Red Hat being a big contributor. It
is intended to be an open-source alternative to [[id:5fd00c79-ed84-43d5-a0c2-3b7a3b25c0ef][AWS
Serverless]]. Knative, AWS Serverless, and WASM fall
into the category of "Function as a Service" or FaaS.

There are two primary components to Knative.
- Serving :: The request-driven model that scales to zero
- Eventing :: The decoupled, event-driven architecture

This [[https://github.com/cncf/wg-serverless/blob/master/whitepapers/serverless-overview/cncf_serverless_whitepaper_v1.0.pdf][whitepaper on Serverless]] explains this in detail.

** WASM
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       7a937d3e-57f4-43d1-9b9d-c2c584bc2be0
:END:

Another related technology is Web Assembly (WASM). While Knative and
others have 100+ ms load times, WASM promises sub-10 ms load times.

WASM (web assembly) allows you to run code generated by low-level
languages such as C++ or Rust in the browser alongside
Javascript. This allows faster number crunching etc. It doesn't
replace Javascript but complements it. WASM isn't a new language; it's
a VM capable of running object code generated from C++, Python, Rust,
etc.

Instead of running AWS Lambda or Knative functions, you could run them
as WASM bytecode on edge servers.
