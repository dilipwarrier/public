* Executive Summary

This report summarizes residential solar energy generation trends in
the United States from 2019 to 2023, with an estimate for 2024. It
focuses on the top three states—California, Texas, and Florida—and
their contribution to national solar output.

- California remains the national leader in solar generation, showing
  steady year-over-year growth.
- Texas has emerged as a fast-growing solar state, with generation
  increasing more than threefold between 2019 and 2023.
- Florida continues to expand solar capacity, although 2023 saw a
  slight decline.
- Together, these three states accounted for over half of U.S. solar
  generation in 2023, though their collective share has declined
  slightly as solar expands nationwide.

These numbers are a combination of residential and commercial energy
generation.

On average, a US home can generate 6 MWh/year of solar energy. Compare
that with average [[id:d51a7c0d-0649-40cf-b9fb-29e759f4ea6a][US household energy consumption]] of 9 MWh/year.
