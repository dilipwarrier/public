According to the
[[https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gases-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references][EPA website]], 9000 grams of CO2 are generated with the consumption of
every gallon of fuel.

1 kWatt-hour of generated power causes 950 pounds of CO2 emission.
1 kWatt-hour of generated power results in 1/(1-0.073) kWatt-hour of
delivered power to the house.
