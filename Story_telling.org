* Seth Godin on why story telling is important                       :Review:

The map is not the territory, most importantly it's a conceptual
framework. When we say something that's compelling but not true, we
dupe our audience. That may work for a while but, sooner or later, we
will get caught. However, when we say something that's both
interesting and true, then we go beyond the facts and create a
powerful story. We must always aim to create such a powerful story.
