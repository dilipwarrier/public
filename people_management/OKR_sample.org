* Introduction

  For all Key Results, completion is 100% if the target is hit. It
  reduces by 20% for each unit we do worse and increases by 10% for each
  unit we do better. For example, for the first target, if the average
  achieved is 7 days, the completion rate will be 80%. If it is 5 days,
  the completion rate will be 110%.

  The completion rate for each KR will always be >= 0%.

  The average completion rate across all KRs for one objective will
  always be <= 100%.

  The OKRs for Q3 are as follows.


* Objective 1

  - Deals are moved from "Stage 1" to "Stage 4" within 4 calendar weeks.

  - SoWs are provided within 1 calendar week from the request.


* Objective 2

  - At least 4 hours of training courses/team member are completed in Q3.

  - 10% or fewer of estimated story points are incomplete at the end of
    the sprint.
