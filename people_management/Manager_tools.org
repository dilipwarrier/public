* Leader's intent

  [[https://www.manager-tools.com/2015/08/leaders-intent-part-1-hall-fame-guidance][Link to podcast]]

  Communicate less about the how and more about the why.

  Eisenhower: Planning is everything; plans are nothing.

  Good judgement comes from experience, experience comes from bad
  judgement. This is the only way to get growth out of your team.

  Communicate your plans and why. For instance, if you are looking for
  cost-cutting, communicate at a high-level why costs need to be cut
  and roughly how much. You want to stay out of the weeds in terms of
  details and communicate only the intent.
