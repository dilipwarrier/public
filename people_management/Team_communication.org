** Introduction

Post the pandemic of 2020-21, teams are increasingly working
remotely. This is in general a healthy phenomenon. It allows us to
find talented people irrespective of where they choose to live. It
encourages diversity of thought as people in different locations may
think differently about issues. It eliminates the wasteful activity of
commuting from your home to your workplace, thus saving time, personal
energy and carbon emissions.

On the negative side, working with team members who are not near you
has not been evolutionarily programmed into you. Also, working with remote
teams can potentially wear you out due to different time zones. This
can lead to added work-related stress. To mitigate these disadvantages, we must cultivate
some habits to make it a better experience. This note suggests some
guidelines on improving the overall remote co-working experience.
