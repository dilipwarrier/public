* Organization

  - Once a quarter, review team succession planning list
    (see manager tools recommendations on ready now/ready later)

  - Once a quarter, review projects with other stakeholders like
    product planning and publish list of projects for the next quarter
    for the team.


* Town hall meetings

  Town hall meetings are a good way to broadcast information, discuss
  financial results, have detailed Q&A etc. I conduct town halls once
  every quarter.
