#+Title: A list of standard work tasks that a manager may need to do
#+Filetags: :Manager:

* Schedule management

  - Once a week on Friday, clean up calendar for the upcoming week


* Direct reports

  - Once a week, check if any action items are overdue

  - Once a month, ask the direct reports: "Overall, how are you
    doing?"


* Organization

  - Once a quarter, review team succession planning list
    (see manager tools recommendations on ready now/ready later)

  - Once a quarter, review projects with other stakeholders like
    product planning and publish list of projects for the next quarter
    for the team.

* Town hall meetings

  Town hall meetings are a good way to broadcast information, discuss
  financial results, have detailed Q&A etc. I conduct town halls once
  every quarter.
