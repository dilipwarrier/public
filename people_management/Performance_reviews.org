#+Title: Automatic setup of performance review steps
#+FILETAGS: :Manager:

In my organization, we typically have informal quarterly performance
reviews and a formal performance review at the end of the
fiscal year. There are a set of steps for each performance review. In
this note, we setup the tasks that need to be executed in each cycle.

This table contains the set of tasks that need to be run. For each
task, an offset can be specified that states when the task should be
scheduled relative to a base date.
