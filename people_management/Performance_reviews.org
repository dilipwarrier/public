* Performance reviews

  In my organization, we typically have informal quarterly performance
  reviews and a formal performance review at the end of the fiscal
  year. There are a set of steps for each performance review. In this
  note, we setup the tasks that need to be executed in each cycle.

   - Make 1-1s with directs 1 hour to do quarterly performance reviews
     and goal updates

   - Create tasks for directs to update and submit goals and
     development plan

   - Request quick feedback on directs from peers

   - Complete my quarterly performance review
