* Manager


** Manager basics


*** One-on-ones

     - 25 minutes every week - rarely missed
        - 10 min: Direct
        - 10 min: Manager
        -  5 min: Future (e.g. career development, feedback etc.)

     - Your relationship with your direct is an emotional bank account
        - 1-1s are deposits; you may need to make withdrawals in times of stress

     - Through 1-1s, great managers know each individual's strengths and gaps in detail

     - 1-1 is a platform that you are providing to your direct report

     - As you do 1-1s consistently, you'll notice that direct reports
       will have less questions for you. They'll wait for the 1-1
       instead.

     - Make sure you make notes during your 1-1.

     - Ask the same question each time to your direct
       (e.g. "How is it going?")

     - 1-1s are not micro-management. Micro-management means telling
       people when, what and how to do something.

     - If your direct wants to talk about family, then you probably want to
       talk about that too.


*** Feedback

     Format of feedback:
     1. May I give you some feedback?
     2. When you did X, Y happened.
     3. Thank you for doing that or could you do that differently?

     Don't use feedback as punishment. People will just find ways of
     covering up in the future. Neither punishment nor praise helps
     improve productivity. Productivity drives happiness and not vice
     versa. You cannot take responsibility to make your directs happy.

     Feedback should be done often and on small things. Feedback is
     like potato chips. Any one chip doesn't really matter but, when
     you eat a whole pack, it has an impact. Feedback can be delivered
     within 30 seconds. Concentrate on keeping it that small. It will
     allow you to deliver it frequently.

     Your tone should be casual and easy and it should be the same in
     case of positive feedback or negative feedback. You can do that
     by focusing on what you want the direct to do in the future, not
     what the direct did in the past. That will ensure that the tone
     is enthusiastic irrespective of whether the feedback is positive
     or negative.

     The second and third time should be exactly the same; no more
     negative tone than the first. Usually, you have to do it seven times
     before you decide you have a different problem.

     Always ask if the direct is ready for feedback. Otherwise, they
     may be too distracted, in which case the feedback will be
     ineffective.

     Feedback should not be about what is going on in your directs'
     minds. You are not a psychologist. Instead, feedback should focus
     on behaviors:
     - What and how they communicate (verbal or written)
     - Facial expressions and body language
     - Work product (quality, accuracy, timeliness)
     Be specific about which action the direct should either repeat or
     should stop.

     Don't say "I felt that..." If you say that, you're making an
     interpretation of their behavior. Focus instead on the behavior:
     "When you...".

     The description of the impact should be based on the [[#DISC_profile][DISC profile]]
     of the direct.

     When you give feedback, the focus should be on the future, not the
     past. Your direct may get defensive about the feedback but that is
     based on defending what they did in the past. You should let the
     defense slide (i.e. ignore it completely) and focus on what
     behavior modification needs to happen for the future.

     Provide positive feedback only first, and only to your star
     performers. This matches well with the guideline of spending more
     time on your star performers.


**** Feedback for remote directs

    Whether the direct is remote or not, feedback should work exactly
    the same as above: frequent, short, mostly positive occasionally
    negative. Insist on giving feedback with face-to-face Zoom calls
    as opposed to phone calls.


*** Delegation

     Assume a box with 20 gray balls.  It represents your ability to be
     productive at work and is inflexible.  It represents 60 hours of
     potential work a week.

     There is white space in the box around the balls and this is
     normal (time for lunch, breaks etc.)

     5 of the balls are big and 15 are small. Assume here that the big
     balls are the more important things (this is usually not true;
     people do the things they like and not the things they should do).

     Small balls are not trivial (For example, submitting an expense
     report is a trivial task).

     Assume that 5 small balls are equivalent to 1 big ball.

     Further, assume that each person in the management org has a box
     and assume that each person has 5 direct reports.

     Finally, assume that you are a Director with 5 direct reports,
     each of whom have 5 direct reports. You report to a VP who has 5
     directs including you.

     As time progresses, each ball shrinks because you get better at
     each task.

     The CEO just got a new customer, which translates to a new big
     orange ball, You get a corresponding new big ball due to this new
     business.  However, your box is fixed and the ball won't fit.

     3 possible solutions:
       - Delegate the big orange ball
       - Delegate a big gray ball
       - Delegate 5 small gray balls

     Option 1 is a bad idea because it's a new task; you need to learn
     it i.e. turn it from orange to gray. Otherwise, you will have to
     ask your delegate to talk to your manager about the task, which is
     inefficient.

     Balls increase in size as they move down the hierarchy. This is
     because you have learnt how to do a task and, so, it is small to
     you but it will be big for your report.

     So, option 2 is not good because it is big for you and bigger for
     your direct, which will crush them.

     Option 3 is best because a small gray ball for you will become a
     big ball for your report but still manageable.

     Saying no is not an option.

     Getting rid of small or big balls is not good either.  If everyone
     is busy, no organization can grow or change (without hiring).
     Those balls are small for you but are huge lower down in the
     organization. So, dropping them is not good for the org; instead,
     you should delegate and ask your report to delegate until the
     small balls at the level of the individual contributor are
     dropped.

     Assigning work to someone that is a natural piece of work for them
     is not delegation. In order to be considered delegation, it must
     be work that you have to do that you assign to someone else.  For
     this, you'll need commitment power, not compliance power. For
     delegation, we must ask directs and, if they say no, we must walk
     away.

     The steps are as follows.

     1. State your desire - "Mike, I'd like your help."

     2. Need/want/like - They need to develop something or want to
        develop something or you'd like them to do something because
        they're good at it - "Mike, you're my best writer."

     3. Ask for acceptance before giving all the details - "Would
        you please take responsibility for our budget process?"

        If they say no, ask for the reasons for objection. - "If I
        addressed your objections, would you be OK with it?"

        At this point, they are going to start taking notes and listening
        more carefully.

     4. Now, describe in detail - What's going to be involved?
        What will the direct do? Here's how your objections can be
        addressed.

     5. State the details of how you will govern the process:
         - Deadlines
         - Quality
         - Reporting
         - What do you need from me?


*** Coaching

     Feedback makes incremental changes. Coaching helps individuals
     move to a different level of effectiveness. Feedback is tactical
     while coaching is strategic.

     You are not a trainer; you are a coach. Managers do not need to be
     experts at what they coach. If we don't do this, there are very
     limited coaching opportunities.

     On the positive side, coaching is required because the market
     environment can change significantly (discontinuities), requiring
     new skills, or for career development. [Each of us needs to
     prepare a succession plan.]

     Use 5 minutes during your weekly 1-1.

     Coaching is most effective when it's collaborative. It's like a
     treasure hunt where two players each hold half of the map.  There
     is a relaxed feel to coaching. (Is this contradictory

     Goal, resources, plan, act.

     Step 1: Collaborate with our direct and set a goal (a measurable
     result with a deadline). It has to be a goal that actually
     involves doing something, it can't be just reading a book or
     taking a class (although reading a book may be the first step of a
     goal).

     Step 2: Collaborate with our direct and decide resources. Take 2-3
     minutes to figure out a list of potential resources. This should
     be a large list of 20 to 30 items.

     Step 3: Collaborate with the direct and plan next steps on about 3
     resources.

     Step 4: Direct report acts on the plan (no collaboration here;
     this is entirely on the direct).

     Celebrate the success!


*** Rolling out the basic practices

    Every manager should do the following.
    - 1-1s
    - Feedback
    - Coaching
    - Delegation

    Never introduce (implement) a managerial change without first
    introducing (communicate) that change

    Great executives have:
    - Great relationships with directs through 1-1s
    - Clear and frequent feedback to directs
    - Coaching and demanding notably better performance over time
    - Delegating a lot to your directs

    "Doing" activities that position you as a leader versus "Being" a
    leader.

    Practice 1-1s for 6-8 weeks before you introduce the next aspects
    of the trinity (feedback, coaching etc.)


** Direct reports


*** New hires

    A culture of effective professionalism must be taught, gaining it
    organically is slow and error-prone.

    Relationships matter. Your direct reports have to build relations
    with other organizations that you do work with. They should not rely
    on your connections. For instance, when someone from your team
    wanted something from HR, he should talk to them directly and not
    ask you to follow up.

**** Family first

    [[https://www.manager-tools.com/2022/01/first-meeting-new-direct-series-family-first-part-1][Link to podcast]]

    Setup a meeting towards the end of your on-boarding 1-1 series
    with your direct report with "Family first" as the topic.

    Family and self come first, work is always second. There's always
    going to be more work than time to do it.

    Work hard and do your best during your working hours; then go home
    and spend quality time with your family.


*** My direct is resigning

     [[https://www.manager-tools.com/2014/10/my-direct-resigning-chapter-1-never-counter-offer-part-1-hall-fame-guidance][Podcast link]]

     The two things a manager are responsible for are results and
     retention.


**** Congratulate them first!

     We think of the negatives of the person leaving the job and become
     defensive. Many companies don't manage your careers, people are now
     more responsible for their own careers. They have gone out of their
     way to do a resume and interview. So, they've achieved something. Say
     "Congratulations! Tell me more about the offer you have!"


**** Gather information

     At this point, the direct has done a lot of work to get a
     counter-offer without your information. You may use words like:
     "Find out more, tell me the whole story: your job, responsibilities, etc."

     Managers will never be able to make directs happy if they are
     focused on just getting a better salary.

     You may something like "I respect you, I admire you; you make my
     job easy. I'll miss you." Don't mention the cost of replacing the
     person, that holds true for anyone, so it's not a factor in the
     process.

     At this stage, you should still not make a counter-offer. However,
     you can ask, "Have you made a decision? If not, by when do you need
     to make a decision?"

     At this point, they may say that they have
     already accepted the offer. That implies that you can't take any
     action.

     An offer should have the following components. You should find out
     all these components. It can help you get industry information even
     if you are going to lose this person.
     - Job description, position, who you report to, location
     - Compensation package: pay, benefits etc.
     - Decision date


**** Never make a counter-offer

     Likelihood of success is low. You may only be able to keep them for
     the short-term.

     Cost/benefit analysis: You're paying more for essentially damage
     control (the cost of having to go out and hire a
     replacement). However, this person has high likelihood of leaving
     later anyway.

     Relationship damage: In order to maintain status quo (pay a person
     more to do the same job as before), you will need to call in
     favors. Neither you nor your boss will readily want to do
     this. This is especially true for big companies.


*** How to fire someone (almost)

    [[https://www.manager-tools.com/2006/02/how-to-fire-someone-well-almost][Podcast link]]

    The following are the steps in failure coaching.
    - Feedback
    - Systemic Feedback
    - One on One Performance Discussion
    - Coaching
    - Formal Performance Discussion and Notification
    - Coaching Within Your Corporate Process

    At each step, you have to try to hardest to turn around the
    performance problem.

    Systemic feedback sounds like the following. You only invoke it
    after you have given feedback multiple times.

    May I give you some feedback? When I ask you to improve your slides
    and I have to give you repeated feedback, I worry that we have a
    bigger problem on our hands. Your performance suffers and I cannot
    assign you special projects...

    The One-on-one performance discussion is where you first document
    the performance issue. You make it a part of the 1-1 agenda and you
    ask if there is something going on in your direct's lives that is
    affecting things.

    If things still haven't worked out, you start a 3-month coaching
    process.

    The formal performance discussion comes in if even the coaching
    process has failed. At this point, you notify the direct that they
    could be fired if their performance does not improve.


** Peers


*** Peer one-on-ones

    See also [[#peer_feedback][peer feedback]].

    Early in your career, you will need results power and expertise
    power. However, as you grow into senior leadership roles, you need
    to add in relationship power. This is what you gain through peer
    1-1s.

    You would have a peer 1-1 with anyone who reports to your boss, even
    if they are a VP and you are a director. You don't need to have peer
    1-1s with every one of your peers. You can pick and choose, based on
    people who you need to work with most closely. It should not be
    based on which people you like the most, nor should you spend time
    with the people you have the worst relation with just to repair the
    relationship.

    Another consideration is whether your boss works closely with
    another person in the org. Then, you may want to have peer 1-1s with
    people who report to them.

    The general recommendation is to start with 2-3 peer 1-1s every week
    and get to 5 peer 1-1s every week.

    Be brisk and efficient; it should not be a chit-chat meeting. Spend
    15 minutes giving operational updates. Prepare in advance to decide
    which of your team's work is relevant to that person. Don't assume
    that they have read your emails on a subject. Don't assume that they
    need to know everything on the subject; make some qualitative
    choices based on your understanding of them.

    Use a majority of the time to give your updates and ask for
    questions/help for a short part of the time (always at the
    end). That way, you build a relationship by giving into it and only
    taking from it later. Better relationships lead to improved
    operational productivity.

    As part of the updates, you can also pre-wire
    them for something you'll present to the boss. You can also talk
    about the details of some of your directs' performance so that
    they can defend them if it comes time for promotions/layoffs.

    Make sure you end the meetings on time. Resist the urge to make this
    a chat session.

**** Manager tools: What you call politics, we call collaboration    :quotes:


*** Conflicts with peers

    The example is one of where the peer hasn't delivered something but
    the guidance applies more generally.

    Use the following steps:

    - Keep it to yourself :: Don't talk about
      conflicts in public forums. Keep it to yourself.

    - Filter out the emotions :: Facts are actionable. Don't use
      emotions as grounds for complaints.

    - Focus on the work :: When you're talking to your direct,
      focus on the work, specifically "who does what by when?". See
      what has been impacted from that lens.

    - Rise above the muck :: No matter what the provocation from your
      peer, you should stay professional. You should also guide your
      direct to do the same.

    - Ask again :: If a task has been missed, ask the direct to ask
      again and give a new
      deadline. ASAP is not an option. This constitutes a second
      instance of the problem (only if you give a new deadline and it
      is not met).

    - Help with the communications :: Review what your direct will
      email/say. Make sure the tone is professional with no slight,
      sarcasm etc.

    - Ask to be kept posted :: Make sure you get updates from your
      report regularly on progress, especially if the matter gets
      resolved.

    - If needed, you call :: If the matter is not resolved, you call
      the peer with the same polite, professional approach. Your direct
      should not have to do it more than twice. You have to take over
      after that.
      For instance, "Paul, just calling to ask for your
      help on project X. We're getting behind, and need your documents
      by net Tuesday. Please call me and let's make sure we're on the
      same page."

    - Keep copious records :: Whatever emails/Slack messages you get,
      keep records of them. If things go well, you can throw them away
      afterwards. If things go south, you will give your boss a
      detailed verbal summary with facts and dates.


*** Feedback for peers
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: peer_feedback
    :END:

    For peers, we leave out steps 1 and 3. We leave out step 1
    because we are not expecting people to change behavior. We leave
    out step 3 because, again, we do not have role power to expect
    them to change. Step 2 remains exactly the same.

    We should keep the tone casual and we should give way more
    positive feedback than negative.

    This can be used with the boss too but you need to be very
    careful.


** Boss


*** Managing your boss

    See also [[#Boss_initial][the first few days with your boss]]

    This is really about having a good relationship with your boss as
    opposed to managing them. There are 5 topics you should be thinking
    about.

    - Goals :: You should understand all of them and not just the
      ones that pertain to you.

      Question to ask: What are your goals e.g. revenue, cost,
      responsibilities? Always start with the financials.

      Ensure that you have a quarterly performance review with your
      boss.

    - Communication style :: Are they a leader or a listener? Pace
      of speaking, excited voice or not, gestures etc.

    - Time management :: Try to stick within the time
      limit you have for your 1-1. Be aware if there is something else
      right after your 1-1 that the boss needs to prepare for and be
      prepared to give up some of your 1-1 time for that. Within the
      1-1, use only your half of the time. Then, let them take the
      remaining time or give them the time back.

      Question to ask: What, when, where are your regular meetings?

      You need to match your time management to your boss' methods: for
      instance, if they prefer to drop in on you spontaneously rather
      than having arranged meetings, then you'll need to adjust to that.

    - Working style :: Question to ask: What do they delegate and
      what decisions do they want to be involved in?

    - Relationships :: Who are their best relationships with and who not.


*** Helping your manager decide

    For big decisions, use the SOCCR model. For smaller decisions, make
    sure you understand your manager's DISC profile first. Some people
    prefer having a lot of information because they don't want to rule
    out options too quickly. Some people make decisions very fast.

    Your job is to present all the data and the consequences of not
    making a decision. After that, you should learn to be OK if the
    manager still doesn't make a decision.


** Relationships


*** Pinch/crunch model for a relationship

    In any relation, there will be times when there are pinches in the
    relationship. A pinch in your relation with your boss might be when
    you fail at some deliverable that your boss had. A pinch in the
    relation with your direct might be when a direct doesn't report to
    you that they are going to be late for a deadline.

    You should plan for pinches in advance e.g. let your direct know
    that they must communicate if they are late. You should use the
    feedback tool when there is a pinch in the relation caused by a
    direct.

    For a pinch caused by you to a peer or to your manager, you must
    apologize. It's OK to have pinches and you can reset the
    relationship after a pinch. But, it is not OK to let pinches
    fester. If pinches continue for a long time, they turns into
    crunches and it's very hard to recover the relationship from
    crunches.

*** Internal customer relationships
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: internal_customers
    :END:

    When you're in a new role, first focus on doing the basics well in
    the first few weeks and months: 1-1s, feedback, coaching,
    delegation.

    In addition, [[https://www.manager-tools.com/2006/11/jump-starting-internal-customer-relationships][this podcast]] informs you how to look outside your team
    for feedback. By becoming the voice of the customer, you gain instant
    credibility with the team.

    The steps are as follows.
    - Who are your internal customers?

    - Setup a 30 minute interview: 5 minutes for you with 1 slide,
      25 minutes for them.

    - Slide should have 4 bullets :
      + Team's mission
      + Where you are with respect to the mission
      + 90-day plan
      + This meeting's purpose

    - Ask everyone the same set of standard questions:
      + What do you or your org need from us?
      + What metrics will you measure me by?
      + How have we done so far on these metrics?
      + What is your perception of my org?
      + What guidance do you have for me?

    - Analyze the data (answers across the board to the same question)

    - Present the analysis to your team and ask for suggestions
      for improvement

    The tone of this meeting should be subordination. You are focusing
    on creating relationships (personal vs formal or business relationships).


** Communication


*** Pre-wiring a presentation
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pre_wire
    :END:

     All important presentations are pre-wired. An information briefing or
     decision briefing must feel like a slam-dunk. However, the slam-dunk
     doesn't happen in the presentation or briefing; it happens in the
     pre-wiring process.

     This advice also applies when your direct presents in your boss'
     staff meeting. Your direct doesn't have enough information about
     your boss or about your peers. You must prep them. (Give the team the
     example of your direct's directs giving presentations during our staff
     meetings. Your direct must be briefed first. Use this and
     presentations in Lei's staff meeting for pre-wiring.)

     - Know your time limit :: Make sure you know how much time you
          have. Start with that, the information in the briefing matters
          less.

     - Decide your key message :: 1 slide every 5 minutes. They don't
          need to know every detail you know.

     - Prep slides in draft form and brief your manager

     - Get a list of attendees :: Decide which attendees are key
          attendees who will need pre-wiring. Make sure anybody who may
          disagree or have a strong opinion is part of the pre-wiring
          process.

     - Brief key attendees :: Draft will go through multiple
          revisions. Take care of curve-balls and disagreements. Request
          30 minutes and walk through the slides (pre-reads may not be
          read).

     - Re-brief your manager :: Still a draft. Tell your manager the
          changes that you have made.

     - Finalize your slides and rehearse your presentation

     The goal of this exercise is to have no surprises and you want to get
     agreement.

*** Open door policy

    This does not mean that your door is open all the time.

    It means that anyone in the company can setup time to talk to you on
    any topic, with emphasis on management related issues.

    As an executive, you're allowed to ask what the meeting is about. They
    are not confidential or anonymous except in very rare cases of whistle
    blowing.

    The requesting employee must follow the chain of command, except when
    retribution might be a factor.


** Decision making

   Once you make a choice, the work is not done. Decisions comprise of
   making a choice, communicating it and managing its implementation.

   Executives cannot make a choice and then walk away and let others take
   care of the details. Ideas are important but not enough.

   Drucker: "No decision has been made unless carrying it out in
   specific steps has become someone's work assignment and
   responsibility. Until then there are only good intentions."

   For example, you can make a choice to invest more in Asia. However,
   you have to then decide how to plan that work.

   Individuals complete tasks, managers assign tasks, executives assign
   people. They decide "who will do what, by when".


** Managing your time

   You don't manage your time, you manage your priorities.

   You don't get paid to do more things, you get paid to do the most
   important things.

   Use the following steps.

   1. Figure out the things you worked on in the last 3 weeks - use
      only pen and paper

   2. Capture your top priorities (source material: job descriptions,
      performance reviews etc.). There should be less than 5 of these.
      - Ask what the role requires of you, not what you want to do.

   3. Do a rough time analysis either based on your past 15 working
      days (3 working weeks) or by timing yourself for the next 3
      work-weeks (Drucker analysis)
      - Put your number 1 priority on your calendar.

   Yellow peanut M&M - that is your work while your self and your
   family are the sun.  If you hold up the M&M against the sun, they
   may seem of the same size but they are not.


** Creating a playbook

   Effective managers have a playbook. Experienced managers have dealt
   with many issues in their lifetime. To make your team more
   confident and resilient, you have to share your playbook with your
   direct reports.

   A playbook is like an NFL playbook with plays for a series of
   challenges/opportunities. You share it with your team and you run
   the play. A play is usually just a one-paragraph outline as opposed
   to a detailed sequence of steps. Each play does not need to be
   perfect. It just needs to be your best assessment.

   As a manager or an executive, you will face many situations where
   you don't know what to do. That is expected.

   Instead, realize in advance that you will face such a situation and
   do not panic. Think through the situation, form a plan of action
   and then write it down. That becomes a page in your playbook. You
   then describe the play to your team and say, "Here's the play we
   are going to run". Then, you must ask the team for ideas. It is OK
   for your team to suggest ideas to change parts of the play.


* Job search and career


** Creating an effective resume

   Update your resume once every quarter

   Resume does not need to include a statement of purpose.

   For each job, list the responsibilities and accomplishments.


** Cover letter

   Three paragraphs:

   - First, state your interest and the position you are interested
     in, where you saw it and who referred you within the company.

   - Second, describe how your experience will help the company match
     its objectives. Do this by matching some of the items in the job
     description with accomplishments in your resume.

   - Third, promise to follow up with a phone call.


** Searching for a job


*** The big picture

    A job search is not easy. You need to use multiple channels for
    your job search, not just one. The channels are as follows.

       - Companies you know :: You have driven past them, know of them,
         admire them etc. If you know someone in the company, it might
         be useful for them to refer you rather than submit your resume
         directly.

       - Companies you don't know :: Do your research
         (Google/LinkedIn/Indeed etc.). Use location-based
         searches. This list is much bigger than the companies you know
         of, because you typically only know of B2C companies.

       - Job boards :: Use more than one.

       - Your connections :: Maintain a healthy list of networking
         connections whom you've been in touch with. Reach out to them:
         in person coffee/lunch/dinner is better than voice call is
         better than email/text.

       - Recruiters :: You should reach out to recruiters, find the
         ones you are comfortable working with and work with them
         regularly.

*** Be open to opportunities

    You can be happy in your current job and still be open to
    opportunities. Always have the conversation.

    If the job isn't right for you, suggest someone else.

    [[https://www.manager-tools.com/2020/10/open-opportunities][Podcast]]


** Interviewing


*** Horstman's 3rd law

    "We'll take 90% less ability for 10% more attitude every day of the
    week." This is an exaggerated claim but it is in the right spirit.

    People are hired for technical reasons and fired for personality
    reasons. Interviewing is a wasteful process but energy and
    enthusiasm expressed the right way are crucial.

    Six behaviors to show energy.

    - Smiles :: Your smile must be the first thing the interviewer sees
      about you. This is the highest value behavior.

    - Handshakes :: Make it energetic. Your webbing between the thumb
      and forefinger should touch the other person's webbing.

    - Voice volume :: Men should raise their volume slightly while
      speaking. This allows them to have tonal changes more easily,
      which in turn communicates energy and enthusiasm.

    - Hand gestures :: These are extremely important as a measure of
      energy. There is a gesture box (above the waist, below the
      torso). Gestures inside the box are not useful. You want gestures
      outside the box with fast and sharp responses.

    - Postures :: Lean forward from the waist. This is a useful
      gesture/posture. Do this at least twice in 30 min.

    - Laughs :: Having a laugh or two (a self-deprecating moment etc.)
      will create a relaxing moment.

    The good thing about behaviors is that they can be practised.

    An interview is a sales opportunity. It's not unethical - don't
    assume that you cannot be authentic while practising this behavior.


*** Introduction

    Energy, energy, energy. Pump yourself up in prep!

    Be aware of news about the company, about the local area and
    national news in general so that you can talk about it if needed.

    Make your handshakes energetic (see guidance above).


*** "Tell me about yourself"

    Be able to give a 3-4 minute overview of your career.

    If education was a key part of your life, you should highlight
    it. Remember that you are selling yourself as a candidate and you
    want to make the best impression possible.


*** Significant accomplishments

    Behavioral interview: Ask about past accomplishments because the
    past is the best predictor of the future. Don't ask how the
    candidate will address future problems; they will give you the
    answer you want to hear.

    This is the single most important section of the interview.

    In prep, make a list of your accomplishments. For each
    accomplishment, tag it with traits/skills like leadership,
    problem-solving etc. Then, be aware of all accomplishments under
    the leadership trait, etc.

    Avoid narrating a chronological sequence of events.

    Make sure you start a short description of your accomplishment with one
    sentence. Then, elaborate! For instance, "Here's how I achieved it..."


*** Your turn to ask questions

    Have 3-5 questions memorized

    Make the questions specific

    Think on your feet and ask questions related to the conversation
    you just had. Such questions might take the form "Could you please
    expand on...?"

    Ask questions with broad answers and not specific answers

    Don't ask about the company, the industry and benefits


*** Closing

    "Mike, I want an offer and here's why..."


*** Follow-up

    Hand-written note if possible. Polite e-mail/phone call every week
    for up to 15 weeks.


*** Compensation

    Do research on your expected salary and state it at the
    beginning. Don't bring it up again until you have an offer. You may
    negotiate after you have the offer but be careful! It's often not
    worth it. You want to maintain good relations with the people who
    you will be working with later.


** First 90 days in a new job

   The theme of [[https://www.manager-tools.com/2012/06/90-day-new-job-plan-overview][the first 90 days]] is to "fit in". It is wrong to change
   a lot of things, there is already a disruption due to your
   joining. A new person (you) changes the relationship structure.

   You may start 1-1s in the first 90 days but you may not start giving
   negative feedback. Crises that require immediate solutions are
   rare. Don't make changes based on role power because, then, you are
   only relying on compliance energy and not relationship energy.

   1. Fit in, fit in, fit in. Go slow.

   2. Take notes throughout your meetings.

      Who do you interact with (including your boss)?

      How do they behave?
      Where do they fit in the DISC profiles?
      Personal details

      What processes does your company use?

      Who are your [[#internal_customers][internal customers]]?

   3. Think about what your top priority will be but don't roll
      it out yet. Do some cost-benefit analysis. You should only have
      1-2 priorities.

      Your top priority must be something that your boss cares about.

   4. Establish some measurement baselines so that you can measure
      improvements.  Otherwise, you do not know that the changes you
      are implementing are actually improving things.

   5. At the end of 90 days, make one change at a time, not many
      changes together. Remember changes need to be [[#pre_wire][pre-wired]].


*** The boss                                                           :Boss:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: Boss_initial
    :END:

    1. Peers

       Learn all your boss' peers' names. Look at the org chart. Work
       with the admin.

    2. Preferences

       - Is your boss generally a reader or a listener?

       - Early morning meetings or late stayer?

       - Well-thought out plan or fly by the seat of the pants?

       - Want you to make decisions or want to be aware of decisions?

       Make notes from joint meetings on insight on these preferences.

    3. Strengths and weaknesses

       - If the boss is abrasive, smooth things out afterwards.

       - Become a safety net for him/her, so that you smooth over his/her
         vulnerabilities.

       It's not good to make your boss look bad. It's good to bail your
       boss out when it is needed. You are tainted by any inadequacies
       of your boss.

       Make notes from joint meetings on insight on these strengths and
       weaknesses.

    4. [Bonus] DISC profile

       Do a DISC profile of your boss, using their communications.


*** Relationship building
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: Relationships
    :END:

    Building relationships is one of the most important things you need
    to do.

    First step, ask. Ask what people do, ask about processes
    etc. Asking questions is not a sign of weakness.

    Make them gentle open-ended questions, not questions intended to be
    transactional information-gathering. e.g. How long have you worked
    here? Where do you live? Can you tell me how what you do relates to
    what Jill does? Who's the expert on X?

    It's OK to ask personal questions. Ask people's family members'
    names. Make sure you write down the names and birth years. It's not
    rude. On the contrary, not asking about a person's family after
    knowing them on a sustained professional basis is rude.

    This is particularly important for the people/services you will need
    e.g. security, admin, catering, etc. A list from your previous job
    will help you. The best statement you can make is "I don't need
    anything right now; I just wanted to say hello".


*** Setting priorities

   Begin to think about what your top priority will be but don't roll
   it out yet. Do some cost-benefit analysis.

   You should only have 1 or a maximum of 2 priorities.

   Your top priority must be something that your boss cares about.

   Make sure you understand what your "unofficial" job description
   is. If you come in to a job that already has some priorities, don't
   fight it. You have limited political capital in the beginning; you
   shouldn't waste it on this.

   You should define metrics against which you are compared.


** Mentoring

   [[https://www.manager-tools.com/2006/06/basics-mentoring-part-1-2][Podcast link]]

   The mentor-mentee relationship is a 2-person relation. When
   Corporate HR gets involved, the value can be diluted. It's better
   for you to manage that relationship yourself.

   Later in your life, you may want a personal board of directors.

   - Choose someone whom you admire who will be helpful in achieving
     your goals. Your boss cannot be your mentor. In a big company, you
     can find a mentor within.

     Decide what your goals are, before you approach a mentor.

   - Decide how long the relation will last. It shouldn't last any more
     than 3 years. It shouldn't be for a short period of the order of
     weeks. It shouldn't be for specific challenges you face right now,
     such as getting a promotion etc.

   - Make a specific ask to someone to be your mentor. Specify the time
     commitment. Nominally, this may be quarterly in-person meetings
     with periodic phone/email conversations. You have to trust your
     mentor and open up to feedback. You should be ready to share
     details with them that you would not share with your boss, both on
     the professional and personal level.

     You are responsible for the operational part e.g. scheduling
     meetings, sending information for pre-reads, rescheduling as
     necessary etc.

   - For the first meeting, have a resume, performance evaluations,
     key projects etc. Set an agenda. Mix professional and personal
     e.g. a one hour meeting in the office on the professional topics
     followed by a lunch outside to get to know each other personally:
     family, life goals etc.

   - Don't try to educate your mentor
     on the feedback model etc., just take feedback as they give
     you. Listen to the feedback, take notes, make changes.

     Ask specific questions so that you are respectful of their
     time. Make sure you close the loop on guidance they have given
     you. e.g. "Help me learn from what just happened".

     Hand-written thank-you notes are the gold standard of saying
     thanks.


** Planning for layoffs

   [[https://www.manager-tools.com/2007/11/getting-laid-off-finances-rule][Finances rule podcast]]

   Layoffs and firing are a fact of corporate life in every industry
   and at every level. Getting fired can be a liberating experience; you just go find
   another job. However, you need to prepare in advance.

   Cardinal rule: get 6 months of liquidity in your personal finances now! You need to
   be prepared for a period of not finding the next job. That way, you
   remove the stress of worrying about cash flow and can focus on the
   job search.


* Executive


** How to structure an organization

   Don't start with people. The names in the boxes should be the last
   step. The purpose of the organization is found outside the
   organization.

   The rules are as follows.
   1. Ask what results are expected of the organization
   2. Make it as small as possible
   3. Only one person in a box

   The steps are as follows.
   1. Draw out the org with boxes below it. Calculate a rough
      cumulative cost and make sure it is within budget.
   2. Decide who goes in the top box. Then, iterate all the boxes
      below based on that person's strengths and weaknesses.


** Leader's intent

   [[https://www.manager-tools.com/2015/08/leaders-intent-part-1-hall-fame-guidance][Link to podcast]]

   Communicate less about the how and more about the why. This is the
   only way to get growth out of your team.

   Communicate your plans and why. For instance, if you are looking for
   cost-cutting, communicate at a high-level why costs need to be cut
   and roughly how much. You want to stay out of the weeds in terms of
   details and communicate only the intent.


*** Eisenhower: Plans are nothing; planning is everything.           :quotes:


*** Manager tools: Good judgement comes from experience, experience comes from bad judgement. :quotes:


** Executive waypoint

   Have conversations and prepare notes from manager, stakeholders,
   loved ones, customers: ask them what your goals should be, ask them
   what your blind spots are.

   Then, reflect on this: Who do you want to be? You can absolutely
   change any of your behaviors. You can make conscious choices to
   change.

   Use the following 4 growth perspectives:
   - Personal/family
   - Company/industry
   - Organizational
   - Professional/career

   Based on these, write down "I will..." kind of statements. There can
   be 3-5 of these.

   Use a state of isolation (a state in which your mind is isolated
   from the output of other people's minds) to think through this.

   At the end of the day, determine the set of insights/actions/initiatives
   that you are going ahead with.

   An insight should be actionable. For instance:
   "You need to build a better relation with your top customer"
   ->
   "I will build a better relation with my top customer"

   Org charts and resulting organizations are a good source for
   actionable insights. So are succession plans.

   Connect with your DISC profile so that actions stretch you on the
   DISC profile.

   You should end up with no more than 3 goals.

   Important next step: Plan out a set of tasks for each of the 3
   goals.


** Purpose of the executive
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: purpose_focus_horizon
   :END:

   An executive is generally defined by three characteristics.

   - Purpose ::
     The executive exists only to serve the purpose of the entire
     organization, not to serve one's own purposes or one's own
     sub-organization's purposes.

   - Focus ::
     The executive must shift their focus from inside the organization
     to outside the organization. The results of an organization are
     generally found outside it. Costs are internal to the
     organization, including yourself.

     Executives must give up on internal politics etc. and focus on
     external networks, connections and knowledge-seeking.

   - Future ::
     A manager becoming an executive must not just capture results but
     must also invest the proceeds of those results in the
     future. Thus, by definition, executives must have a longer time
     horizon in their thinking.

   A CEO should not be the only executive in the company. That's
   unhealthy for large organizations.

   A typical mistake that executives make is doing more of the same
   thing that they have been doing on getting promoted. You have to
   make a phase transition in your thinking i.e. move to a different
   S-curve.


** Executive S-curve and the box

   As a manager getting promoted to an executive, you are moving from
   one S-curve to another.

   You now have certain freedoms and certain
   responsibilities. Try to constrain yourself on the freedoms/role
   powers that you have. Focus instead on the responsibilities. Your
   responsibilities are towards the entire organization, even if it
   means at the loss of your own sub-organization (see [[#purpose_focus_horizon][Purpose]]). You
   have to give up on building your fiefdoms and focus on the greater
   good of the organization.


** The hallmark of an executive

   The number one hallmark is the discipline to determine what needs
   to be done in the organization and then the discipline to do it.

   The classic assumption is that executives know more about business,
   strategy, finance etc. Instead, discipline is the one quality that
   is dispositive. Think of the scene from "Men In Black": You put on a
   black suit and it's the only suit you'll ever wear.


** Ditch the ladder

   Junior executives think there is a career ladder but there isn't.

   - Ditch the ladder :: Ladders have rungs equally spaced and, if you
     slip, you'll just move to the lower rung. None of this is true of
     a career. You do not need to aspire to reach the top rung. Being
     the CEO is a tough job; it's not for everyone. Ladders exist but
     they do not go all the way up to the top.

   - Embrace the matrix :: At the top, it's a matrix, not a
     ladder. You may move laterally multiple times. In this domain,
     things are non-linear and you do not move straight up.

   - Results and relationships :: As a manager, your goals are results
     and retention. You might get away because you are very good at
     what you do. However, as an executive, [[#relationships][great relationships]] are the only
     way you will get good results. Executive results are still critical but
     they are mostly achieved through relationships. Executive
     relations are not just among peers and certainly not with just
     your boss. They are up, down and broadly sideways
     and even outside your company (donors, board of directors,
     investors, research universities etc.).

   - Open to opportunities :: Never be stuck in the philosophy of
     "This is the only job I want to do". When an acquaintance
     mentions an opportunity and ask if you know someone, they are
     actually asking if you are interested. Take recruiter calls. You
     are not winning loyalty points by saying you are OK in your
     current job. The advantage of being "open to opportunities"
     is that you can have several informal conversations without it
     being an actual interview.

   - Who should be the next...? :: You would only be asked this
     question if you were being considered for the position. You
     should not push too hard but you should make your case. If you
     are the number 2 choice from many people (their #1 choice will
     always be themselves), you'll get the job.


** Culture

*** What is culture?

    Culture is nothing more than the sum of all acceptable behaviors in
    the organization - the way we do things here.

    It is a result of the adaptation of our behaviors in the organization.

    It is not the sum of values. The culture cannot be a caring culture
    because caring is a value, not a behavior.

    A value can be a starting point but, if the behavior is not in sync
    with the value, then the culture is the behavior and not the value.

    Managers are the guardians of the organizational culture. They must
    model the behaviors and must give feedback to ensure that the
    behaviors are in sync with the values.

    Values are usually on the website. They should be a small
    list. They are meant as an external marketing tool to hire people.

    Behaviors are usually not on a website.

    Behaviors are usually simple statements of the form "We do x"
    e.g. we over-communicate, we document our procedures carefully, etc.

    Each manager decides the sub-culture of their organization. They
    should derive such sub-cultures from the company's reason for
    existence and the change that it wants to implement in society.

  [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/11EE5LYTqOXHLssYnScXwgrpfcRZFVyQ3/view?usp%3Dsharing][My DISC profile - high C]]

  DISC elaborates on "how you behave when you're not thinking about
  how you behave". Note that you can operate in any of the quadrants
  if you practise and you can change where you are to adapt to a
  situation.

  Dominant, Influencing, Supportive, Conscientious (DISC)

  High Ds tend to be leaders, brash. Feedback to them should be about
  how others will value them less as leaders.

  High Is tend to be eager to please and influence. Feedback should be
  about how other people may choose not to work in a team with them.

  High Ss tend to be team-oriented. Feedback should be about how their
  behavior makes the team less successful.

  High Cs tend to be diligent and process-driven. Feedback should be
  about how their behaviors makes them less effective.
